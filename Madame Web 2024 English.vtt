00:01:43.542 --> 00:01:45.044
Do you think we're close?

00:01:46.337 --> 00:01:48.255
They're almost
impossible to find.

00:01:48.964 --> 00:01:51.050
No one's ever
captured one alive.

00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:55.971
I agreed
to provide security for you...

00:01:56.055 --> 00:01:58.682
because I thought you were close
to finding the spider.

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:01.310
Well, it's worth the wait.

00:02:01.393 --> 00:02:02.937
Dead specimens show that

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.189
the peptides
in the spider's venom, they...

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.277
Basically, they supercharge
their cellular structure.

00:02:12.154 --> 00:02:14.615
That spider can give
superhuman strength and power...

00:02:14.698 --> 00:02:16.992
like Las Arañas.

00:02:17.076 --> 00:02:18.619
Las Arañas?

00:02:18.702 --> 00:02:22.623
The mythical spider people
who run across the treetops...

00:02:22.706 --> 00:02:23.832
and punish evil men

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:26.001
with their black,
poisoned touch?

00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:28.254
I like to base my research
in science,

00:02:28.337 --> 00:02:30.005
not legends, Mr Sims.

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:31.799
Those powers are wasted here.

00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:34.301
These little spiders

00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:36.595
have the potential
to cure hundreds of diseases.

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:37.680
It could...

00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:41.016
- Are you okay?
- No.

00:02:41.892 --> 00:02:43.811
She's trying her best
to keep me from working.

00:02:45.396 --> 00:02:47.022
But I'm not
gonna let her do that.

00:02:48.023 --> 00:02:49.316
Not when I'm this close.

00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:53.612
Perhaps you should rest.

00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:56.740
I don't have time.

00:02:59.034 --> 00:03:00.035
Thank you.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.121
For the umbrella.

00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:47.249
I found it.

00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:48.876
I found the spider.

00:03:53.214 --> 00:03:55.007
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Wow.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.800
- Incredible, isn't it?
- Constance.

00:03:56.884 --> 00:03:59.094
Something so small
yet have so much power.

00:04:00.054 --> 00:04:01.055
Okay.

00:04:01.764 --> 00:04:02.765
Okay.

00:04:04.808 --> 00:04:05.809
What are you doing?

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.020
I don't...

00:04:08.103 --> 00:04:09.188
I don't understand.

00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:11.607
I've been searching
for that spider for years.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.026
No, don't...
We could help so many people.

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.528
I'm not interested
in helping people.

00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:18.656
No one helped me
when my family was starving.

00:04:18.738 --> 00:04:20.533
My road was
not as clear as yours.

00:04:20.616 --> 00:04:22.117
We didn't have the same choices.

00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:23.494
You're making
the wrong decision.

00:04:23.577 --> 00:04:24.578
- Give me the spider!
- No.

00:04:24.662 --> 00:04:25.829
You're making
the wrong decision.

00:04:25.913 --> 00:04:27.414
- Give it to me.
- No.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.625
- Give it to me.
- No. Ezekiel.

00:04:29.708 --> 00:04:30.960
- No. Please.
- You could just walk away.

00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:42.137
No.

00:05:59.548 --> 00:06:01.592
Her journey will not be easy...

00:06:01.675 --> 00:06:03.219
but she is strong.

00:06:03.302 --> 00:06:05.512
She will come back
when she needs answers.

00:06:05.596 --> 00:06:07.139
And when she does...

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.309
I will be here for her.

00:06:28.118 --> 00:06:29.328
Come on!

00:06:36.627 --> 00:06:37.753
Move!

00:06:37.836 --> 00:06:39.046
All right! All right!

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.093
This is 2-10
with a 42-year-old female.

00:06:44.176 --> 00:06:45.553
Code three.

00:06:45.636 --> 00:06:47.846
Cassie, I lost the pulse.
I'm starting compressions now.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.266
Ben, what are you
even doing back there?

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:52.142
Oh, you wanna come take over?
I can drive.

00:06:52.226 --> 00:06:53.936
She's not going
room temp on my watch.

00:07:04.572 --> 00:07:05.573
Come on.

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:18.460
How you doing back there?

00:07:18.544 --> 00:07:20.504
You know, last time I was
in a vehicle driven like this,

00:07:20.588 --> 00:07:21.630
I was being shot at.

00:07:21.714 --> 00:07:23.924
I wouldn't want you
to be homesick for the Army.

00:07:24.008 --> 00:07:26.218
Never thought I'd be this happy
to be back in Queens.

00:07:26.302 --> 00:07:27.887
What, you've never been
shot at in Queens?

00:07:39.607 --> 00:07:40.941
Shouldn't you be in school?

00:07:42.818 --> 00:07:44.904
Who flips off an ambulance?

00:07:44.987 --> 00:07:46.238
Oh, you're gonna be okay.

00:07:46.322 --> 00:07:47.740
Jesus.

00:07:49.366 --> 00:07:50.367
Kids.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.709
- I'm gonna get roped in.
- No, you're not.

00:07:58.834 --> 00:08:01.629
You're gonna be in the backyard
grilling with us.

00:08:01.712 --> 00:08:03.839
I know how
these things work, Ben.

00:08:03.923 --> 00:08:05.257
Oh, do you? How do you know?

00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:06.550
I bet you've never even
been to a baby shower.

00:08:06.634 --> 00:08:09.845
Because, yeah,
I'm careful not to get roped in.

00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:11.847
I'm glad I caught you
before you headed back out.

00:08:12.431 --> 00:08:13.432
She's gonna be okay.

00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:16.644
Who?

00:08:16.727 --> 00:08:18.604
Your patient.

00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:21.148
Her little boy
wanted to say thank you.

00:08:24.568 --> 00:08:25.569
You know what,

00:08:25.653 --> 00:08:27.196
Mr Ben Parker here
did all the work, so...

00:08:28.364 --> 00:08:29.365
Just take it.

00:08:29.448 --> 00:08:30.991
Take it.

00:08:31.075 --> 00:08:32.368
Just take it.

00:08:33.619 --> 00:08:35.371
- That's... I mean...
- Thank you.

00:08:35.454 --> 00:08:36.830
- Thanks, buddy.
- Thank you.

00:08:38.374 --> 00:08:39.792
I'll take you in to see her.

00:08:39.874 --> 00:08:41.502
- Are you all immediate family?
- Oh, my God.

00:08:41.585 --> 00:08:42.878
I'm her stepdaughter.

00:08:42.962 --> 00:08:44.547
I think she might prefer...

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.174
Yeah, it's okay, Dad.

00:08:47.258 --> 00:08:49.677
I'll see you guys
back at your apartment?

00:08:50.469 --> 00:08:51.595
Okay.

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:52.680
Come on, buddy.

00:08:53.556 --> 00:08:54.557
Let's go see Mommy.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.434
Okay. This one is for you.
This is for me.

00:08:57.518 --> 00:08:59.270
- Thanks so much.
- You're welcome.

00:09:01.689 --> 00:09:03.607
What am I supposed
to do with this?

00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:05.401
Just put it in your pocket

00:09:05.484 --> 00:09:07.611
and then throw it away
somewhere else.

00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:11.615
Can't even fold it.
It's like cardboard.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:15.619
Come on.

00:09:16.787 --> 00:09:18.914
We both hate family stuff.

00:09:20.291 --> 00:09:22.126
I think I have plans
anyways, so...

00:09:22.209 --> 00:09:23.711
Plans? Since when
do you have plans?

00:09:23.794 --> 00:09:25.629
You're, like,
impossible to pin down.

00:09:25.713 --> 00:09:27.548
Well, I like
to keep my options open.

00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:28.799
You know, I might sleep in.

00:09:28.883 --> 00:09:31.135
I might go to the museum.
I might walk the dog.

00:09:31.218 --> 00:09:32.261
You don't have a dog.

00:09:32.344 --> 00:09:33.846
I might adopt one.

00:09:33.929 --> 00:09:35.014
Return the favour.

00:09:35.097 --> 00:09:37.975
I suspect you were a bit more
of a handful than a puppy.

00:09:38.434 --> 00:09:39.643
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:09:40.311 --> 00:09:42.021
I was a model foster kid.

00:09:42.104 --> 00:09:43.647
I peed outside and everything.

00:09:45.524 --> 00:09:46.817
So...

00:09:49.737 --> 00:09:51.488
I kinda met someone.

00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:53.240
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

00:09:53.324 --> 00:09:54.658
What's this one's name?

00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:03.167
Serious.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.467
She's a lucky lady, Ben.

00:10:13.052 --> 00:10:14.053
Thank you.

00:10:17.181 --> 00:10:18.807
"You have
a winning personality."

00:10:18.891 --> 00:10:20.100
I guess I got yours by mistake.

00:10:21.268 --> 00:10:22.311
You're an asshole.

00:10:22.394 --> 00:10:23.395
Here.

00:10:24.855 --> 00:10:26.774
Let's see what
your future holds for you.

00:10:29.068 --> 00:10:30.486
What if I don't wanna know?

00:10:30.569 --> 00:10:31.779
Well, it's just a cookie.

00:10:37.076 --> 00:10:38.077
"You will."

00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:40.120
You will what?

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.832
- Apparently, I have no future.
- Cassie.

00:10:44.583 --> 00:10:46.418
- Do you know what this means?
- What?

00:10:48.295 --> 00:10:50.297
It means that
their printer is broken.

00:10:50.381 --> 00:10:51.590
We can't eat here any more.

00:10:59.807 --> 00:11:01.809
Yeah, I'll meet you at
the coffee shop at the corner.

00:11:05.604 --> 00:11:07.147
You think
I can manage both of these?

00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:08.232
I think so, yeah.

00:11:08.315 --> 00:11:09.567
We'll have it for you tomorrow.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.443
My dad just needs
to pick up his paycheque.

00:11:12.027 --> 00:11:13.279
Well, let me come in
and talk to your dad.

00:11:13.362 --> 00:11:14.363
I haven't seen him in a while.

00:11:14.446 --> 00:11:15.614
Maybe we can work something out.

00:11:15.698 --> 00:11:17.950
He's not
home right now, actually.

00:11:18.033 --> 00:11:19.451
Look, I'll be back tomorrow.

00:11:19.535 --> 00:11:21.245
But no more excuses.

00:11:21.328 --> 00:11:22.746
I swear. We'll have it.

00:11:23.455 --> 00:11:24.707
All right.

00:12:02.953 --> 00:12:05.080
Us strays
need to stick together.

00:12:06.373 --> 00:12:07.750
{\an8}Somebody's hungry.

00:13:29.957 --> 00:13:32.126
Hope the spiders
were worth it, Mom.

00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:39.049
For your own safety,
please stay where you are.

00:13:42.344 --> 00:13:44.471
You gotta get, like,
Jaws of Life for that.

00:13:45.055 --> 00:13:47.224
MVA, three vehicles.

00:13:47.308 --> 00:13:49.977
One vehicle
flipped over with entrapment.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.770
Copy that. Sending backup
to your location.

00:13:51.854 --> 00:13:52.938
It won't open.

00:13:54.356 --> 00:13:56.233
All right, sir. We're gonna
get you out of there, okay?

00:13:56.317 --> 00:13:58.068
Just don't move.

00:13:58.152 --> 00:13:59.153
Hi, sir.

00:14:00.029 --> 00:14:01.280
Can you tell me your name?

00:14:01.363 --> 00:14:02.740
Robert.

00:14:02.823 --> 00:14:04.909
Robert, I'm Cassie.

00:14:04.992 --> 00:14:06.952
I'm gonna help you out
today, okay?

00:14:07.036 --> 00:14:08.287
You're gonna be all right.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.455
All right,
I'm gonna cut your seat belt.

00:14:09.538 --> 00:14:10.623
And when I do,
you're gonna fall...

00:14:10.706 --> 00:14:12.249
and my partner Ben
is gonna help you out

00:14:12.333 --> 00:14:13.417
on that side, okay?

00:14:14.001 --> 00:14:15.836
Three, two, one.

00:14:16.754 --> 00:14:19.048
All right, Robert.
We're gonna move on three.

00:14:19.131 --> 00:14:20.132
- Okay? Here we go.
- Yeah.

00:14:20.216 --> 00:14:21.634
One, two, three.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.054
Okay. You're gonna be okay, sir.

00:14:25.137 --> 00:14:26.722
Just try and lay still.
We're gonna get you checked...

00:14:27.514 --> 00:14:29.350
- Hey! Cassie!
- Ben!

00:14:29.433 --> 00:14:31.268
- Cassie!
- Ben!

00:14:56.752 --> 00:14:58.170
79 over 55.

00:14:58.254 --> 00:14:59.672
Dial it back, I'm fine.

00:14:59.755 --> 00:15:01.590
You need a real workup
at a real hospital.

00:15:01.674 --> 00:15:03.592
No, you were right.
They're roping ya in.

00:15:03.676 --> 00:15:05.135
Games!

00:15:05.761 --> 00:15:06.804
You guys are ice-cold.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:09.557
Cassie!

00:15:10.057 --> 00:15:12.268
This place has always
been a death trap.

00:15:18.232 --> 00:15:19.775
You can't save all three!

00:15:19.859 --> 00:15:20.860
...you can use the web

00:15:20.943 --> 00:15:23.821
to be in more than one place
at the same time.

00:15:23.904 --> 00:15:26.740
You are the only one
who can change the future.

00:15:26.824 --> 00:15:27.992
No!

00:15:28.075 --> 00:15:29.076
Cassie!

00:15:29.159 --> 00:15:30.536
That's it, Cassie, breathe!

00:15:30.619 --> 00:15:31.745
Come on!

00:15:34.248 --> 00:15:35.833
You're okay. You're okay.

00:15:37.793 --> 00:15:39.044
Did I die?

00:15:39.169 --> 00:15:40.170
Yeah.

00:15:40.254 --> 00:15:42.673
You were down three minutes
before I fished you out.

00:15:42.756 --> 00:15:44.592
- Three minutes?
- Yeah.

00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:48.095
Welcome back
to the land of the living.

00:15:58.397 --> 00:15:59.607
You're not goin' anywhere.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.192
79 over 55.

00:16:01.275 --> 00:16:04.403
You need a real workup
at a real hospital

00:16:04.486 --> 00:16:06.113
with a real doctor.

00:16:06.197 --> 00:16:07.281
I don't need a doctor.

00:16:08.282 --> 00:16:09.325
I trust you.

00:16:10.618 --> 00:16:12.494
Ah, 80%. No, it's great.

00:16:12.578 --> 00:16:14.622
Slightly above that
of a dead fish.

00:16:16.999 --> 00:16:20.794
All right.
Well, O2 is going up to 89.

00:16:22.504 --> 00:16:24.006
Jump back in the water anytime.

00:16:30.262 --> 00:16:31.347
You're not goin' anywhere.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.057
79 over 55.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.101
You need a real workup
at a real hospital

00:16:36.185 --> 00:16:38.020
with a real doctor.

00:16:38.729 --> 00:16:40.773
Seriously, Ben, dial it back.

00:16:40.856 --> 00:16:41.941
I'm fine.

00:16:43.859 --> 00:16:45.861
Wait, wait, wait. I need
to get your oxygen levels.

00:16:45.945 --> 00:16:47.071
Again?

00:16:47.655 --> 00:16:48.656
What are you talking about?

00:16:48.739 --> 00:16:50.157
My O2 is 89.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.285
- Okay, stay back, stay back.
- No, it's...

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.664
Oh, you're right.

00:17:00.543 --> 00:17:01.585
Are you okay?

00:17:01.669 --> 00:17:02.962
What the hell
happened down there?

00:17:03.045 --> 00:17:04.045
I'm fine.

00:17:04.964 --> 00:17:07.675
I just wanna go home
and watch Idol.

00:17:07.758 --> 00:17:09.510
Please stay where you are.

00:18:34.637 --> 00:18:35.638
Wow.

00:18:37.223 --> 00:18:38.515
Great apartment.

00:19:05.376 --> 00:19:07.878
Where's my spider?
They took my spider.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.889
Who are you?

00:19:49.545 --> 00:19:51.213
No!

00:20:03.058 --> 00:20:04.435
Bad dream?

00:20:04.518 --> 00:20:05.644
It's not a dream.

00:20:06.937 --> 00:20:08.647
I'm gonna be murdered one day.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.817
Oh, wow, that's a buzzkill.

00:20:15.738 --> 00:20:17.364
The same three faces.

00:20:19.033 --> 00:20:21.327
Every night, the same vision.

00:20:22.536 --> 00:20:23.954
It's a curse.

00:20:24.038 --> 00:20:25.998
But we all die someday.

00:20:26.081 --> 00:20:28.167
Nothing we can really do
to stop that.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:30.544
But if you saw
who was going to murder you...

00:20:32.254 --> 00:20:33.547
you'd try to stop them.

00:20:34.965 --> 00:20:36.258
Okay...

00:20:37.676 --> 00:20:40.596
You have no idea
of the torment and torture...

00:20:40.679 --> 00:20:43.474
of dying over and over again.

00:20:43.557 --> 00:20:44.892
And I can't escape it.

00:20:45.893 --> 00:20:47.978
So I'm not gonna sit back
and let it happen.

00:20:51.899 --> 00:20:54.401
I will find them
and kill them first.

00:20:55.986 --> 00:20:57.613
So you know who did it...

00:20:57.696 --> 00:21:01.075
I mean, will do it?

00:21:03.577 --> 00:21:05.287
It's always those three faces.

00:21:06.997 --> 00:21:09.583
Can you imagine
how frustrating it's been?

00:21:10.709 --> 00:21:14.088
Trying to identify someone
I've only seen in a vision?

00:21:17.091 --> 00:21:18.509
But as the years pass...

00:21:19.426 --> 00:21:21.512
there have been
technological advances.

00:21:22.805 --> 00:21:25.599
New ways to find people,
if you know their faces.

00:21:27.726 --> 00:21:29.812
The kind of technology
I've heard...

00:21:29.895 --> 00:21:32.731
the National Security Agency
has been pursuing.

00:21:49.248 --> 00:21:50.332
What are you doing?

00:21:52.626 --> 00:21:53.961
How are you poisoning me?

00:21:54.044 --> 00:21:55.462
What's your password?

00:21:56.422 --> 00:21:58.257
I can't tell you. Oh, please!

00:21:59.758 --> 00:22:01.468
Is "please" your password?

00:22:02.636 --> 00:22:05.890
Tell me quickly before
the paralysis reaches your lips

00:22:05.973 --> 00:22:07.349
and I'll stop the poison.

00:22:18.194 --> 00:22:21.447
Q-9-2-0...

00:22:22.156 --> 00:22:25.284
B-3-7-5.

00:22:29.872 --> 00:22:31.582
Oh, God.

00:22:35.586 --> 00:22:39.006
Believe me, it's a good thing
you had no idea...

00:22:39.089 --> 00:22:41.383
today was the day
you were going to die.

00:22:55.189 --> 00:22:56.232
- Hey, Cassie.
- Hey.

00:22:56.315 --> 00:22:58.108
I'm serious. You should
open, like, a barbecue.

00:22:58.192 --> 00:22:59.193
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

00:22:59.276 --> 00:23:00.277
You know what you're doing.

00:23:00.361 --> 00:23:01.820
- I saw him leave.
- Yeah, I...

00:23:01.904 --> 00:23:02.905
Cassie!

00:23:02.988 --> 00:23:05.032
- Hey!
- Hi.

00:23:05.115 --> 00:23:06.909
Hey, the next time
you wanna go swimmin',

00:23:06.992 --> 00:23:08.702
maybe you should
stick to Astoria Park.

00:23:08.786 --> 00:23:11.497
Oh, that's really funny.
You're such a funny guy.

00:23:11.997 --> 00:23:14.041
Are you pressing the burgers?

00:23:14.124 --> 00:23:15.417
I'm releasin' the fat.

00:23:15.501 --> 00:23:16.752
That's called flavour, man.

00:23:16.835 --> 00:23:18.420
Plus, it's, like,
really flammable.

00:23:18.504 --> 00:23:19.797
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

00:23:20.714 --> 00:23:22.633
You don't think that maybe
in light of recent events

00:23:22.716 --> 00:23:23.759
I could use a beer?

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.762
Well, as you know,
the protocol is...

00:23:26.845 --> 00:23:30.182
no booze within
24 hours of your death. So...

00:23:30.266 --> 00:23:32.434
- Is that protocol?
- Yeah, it's protocol.

00:23:32.518 --> 00:23:33.561
That's boring.

00:23:33.644 --> 00:23:35.396
I feel like
there's more of a story there.

00:23:35.479 --> 00:23:36.480
No, there's...

00:23:36.564 --> 00:23:38.357
You guys,
we've seen this a hundred times.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.441
It was cardiac arrest.

00:23:39.525 --> 00:23:42.152
When your heart starts
back up again, you're fine.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.071
Really?

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.073
Dead, huh?

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.742
Did you see a white light or...

00:23:50.452 --> 00:23:53.747
Well, actually, I saw Jersey...

00:23:53.831 --> 00:23:56.041
- so you tell me.
- Oh, come on, you saw...

00:23:56.125 --> 00:23:57.126
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:23:57.209 --> 00:23:58.794
She hit me with a Jersey joke.

00:23:58.878 --> 00:24:00.129
Has he been
pressin' the burgers again?

00:24:00.212 --> 00:24:01.463
Yeah, they're ruined now.

00:24:01.547 --> 00:24:02.882
Take that. For you, sir.

00:24:03.883 --> 00:24:05.676
- Oh, now they're really ruined.
- Oh, okay.

00:24:05.759 --> 00:24:07.678
- We're ready to start.
- What?

00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:09.013
What?

00:24:09.096 --> 00:24:11.223
They're starting,
so you should get in there.

00:24:11.307 --> 00:24:13.309
No, you were right,
they're roping ya in.

00:24:13.392 --> 00:24:15.060
- Yeah. Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

00:24:15.144 --> 00:24:16.145
Have fun.

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.900
- ...for you, okay.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

00:24:20.983 --> 00:24:23.110
- Hi.
- Look at you. Hi.

00:24:23.194 --> 00:24:24.528
Okay. This is crazy.

00:24:24.612 --> 00:24:25.821
Well, I couldn't decide,
so I got two.

00:24:25.905 --> 00:24:27.072
Yeah, that's like...

00:24:27.907 --> 00:24:29.283
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

00:24:30.117 --> 00:24:31.118
Cassie Webb.

00:24:31.619 --> 00:24:32.828
Thanks for having me.

00:24:32.912 --> 00:24:36.123
You're Ben's partner.
I'm his sister-in-law, Mary.

00:24:36.207 --> 00:24:37.750
Nice to meet you.

00:24:37.833 --> 00:24:40.419
Ben is so excited
about being an uncle.

00:24:40.502 --> 00:24:42.046
I don't know
what we'd do without him.

00:24:42.129 --> 00:24:44.131
- Especially with Richard away.
- Again.

00:24:44.882 --> 00:24:46.133
Where is it this time?

00:24:46.217 --> 00:24:47.718
He's in Mumbai...

00:24:47.801 --> 00:24:49.929
Shanghai... I can't keep track.

00:24:52.431 --> 00:24:55.559
Never stops
leaping around in there.

00:24:55.643 --> 00:24:56.644
And always hungry.

00:24:57.853 --> 00:24:59.897
Does it have a name? The...

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:03.817
We're saving that
for one of the games.

00:25:05.027 --> 00:25:06.737
- Games?
- Games!

00:25:10.658 --> 00:25:11.659
Games!

00:25:13.827 --> 00:25:14.828
Okay.

00:25:15.746 --> 00:25:19.458
"My mother always cut the crusts
off my sandwiches."

00:25:21.544 --> 00:25:22.670
Chloe, is that you?

00:25:22.753 --> 00:25:23.754
Yes.

00:25:25.756 --> 00:25:28.592
My mom said the crusts
would make my hair go curly.

00:25:28.676 --> 00:25:30.386
It was years
before I figured that one out.

00:25:34.056 --> 00:25:35.391
Hold up. Hold up. Bernie!

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:37.893
Whose is this?

00:25:39.895 --> 00:25:41.564
Oh, it's mine.

00:25:41.647 --> 00:25:44.650
You must have at least
one fond memory of your mother.

00:25:45.484 --> 00:25:48.612
Well, my mother
actually died in childbirth.

00:25:50.906 --> 00:25:52.783
Well, but it wasn't that bad.
It wasn't like...

00:25:52.867 --> 00:25:55.619
I mean, obviously,
it was bad, you know.

00:25:55.703 --> 00:25:56.871
She died.

00:25:59.373 --> 00:26:01.792
But, I grew up totally healthy.

00:26:03.085 --> 00:26:04.712
Death in childbirth
is super rare.

00:26:05.713 --> 00:26:09.300
I mean, she chose to be, like,
way deep in the Amazon...

00:26:09.383 --> 00:26:11.427
for the last month
of her pregnancy...

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:14.430
hundreds of miles away from
any medical facilities, so...

00:26:14.513 --> 00:26:16.432
Okay, so let's...

00:26:16.515 --> 00:26:17.683
let's move on to the next game.

00:26:19.643 --> 00:26:21.937
Guess the name of Mary's baby.

00:26:22.021 --> 00:26:23.439
Oh, yes!

00:26:23.522 --> 00:26:25.316
Okay, I'll kick things off.

00:26:27.276 --> 00:26:28.611
- Sam.
- Nope.

00:26:28.694 --> 00:26:29.904
Steven.

00:26:29.987 --> 00:26:31.906
- He's not named Steven.
- Shoot.

00:26:31.989 --> 00:26:33.616
- Baby sausage?
- You guys are ice-cold.

00:26:38.078 --> 00:26:39.079
Baby sausage?

00:26:39.705 --> 00:26:41.081
Richard Junior?

00:26:41.165 --> 00:26:42.458
Richard wishes.

00:26:44.251 --> 00:26:45.252
Get your hamburger.
Get your hamburger.

00:26:45.336 --> 00:26:47.254
Cassie... what's your guess?

00:26:53.344 --> 00:26:54.845
Do that thing
where you throw it up

00:26:54.929 --> 00:26:55.930
and catch it on the...

00:26:57.556 --> 00:26:58.557
- Oh, my God.
- Ben?

00:26:58.641 --> 00:26:59.892
- Look at that.
- The name is...

00:27:06.357 --> 00:27:07.358
Baby sausage?

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:10.986
Richard Junior?

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.279
Richard wishes.

00:27:14.657 --> 00:27:15.658
Come on, get your hamburger.
Get your...

00:27:15.741 --> 00:27:17.284
Cassie... what's your guess?

00:27:17.368 --> 00:27:18.619
Put five dollars down, let's go.

00:27:18.702 --> 00:27:20.371
Wait. We just did this.

00:27:20.454 --> 00:27:22.081
Do that thing
where you throw it up

00:27:22.164 --> 00:27:23.165
and catch it on the...

00:27:25.793 --> 00:27:27.962
What, seriously,
is this part of the game?

00:27:30.089 --> 00:27:31.966
Sorry.
They're calling everyone in.

00:27:32.049 --> 00:27:33.551
Fire down at the docks.

00:27:33.634 --> 00:27:34.635
So...

00:27:37.513 --> 00:27:38.514
You okay?

00:27:38.597 --> 00:27:42.560
Yeah. I just got
a weird sense of déjà vu.

00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:44.687
I got you, man.

00:27:45.521 --> 00:27:46.522
I don't...
I don't think it's broken.

00:27:46.605 --> 00:27:48.232
The ones who got out, come on.
This way.

00:27:48.315 --> 00:27:49.358
Get her out. Come on.

00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:50.860
Grabbin' a woman on A-side here.

00:27:52.528 --> 00:27:53.654
Go. Go. Go.

00:27:53.737 --> 00:27:54.947
We need more pressure
in the line.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.448
Keep pressure on the leg
here, okay?

00:27:57.867 --> 00:27:59.660
Okay, looks like
a fractured left radius.

00:27:59.743 --> 00:28:00.744
Otherwise stable.

00:28:02.746 --> 00:28:04.874
Wait, wait, wait.
Check his abdomen.

00:28:07.459 --> 00:28:10.546
Okay, and internal injuries.
Good catch.

00:28:10.629 --> 00:28:11.755
Let's go. Come on.

00:28:16.969 --> 00:28:18.762
Hey, I need
to get my guys in there.

00:28:18.846 --> 00:28:20.347
No, it's not safe.
The structure's unstable.

00:28:20.472 --> 00:28:21.557
Hey, the people are trapped.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.475
We need to treat 'em
before we move them.

00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:25.811
The place is
packed with explosives.

00:28:25.895 --> 00:28:27.646
Industrial grade fireworks.

00:28:28.188 --> 00:28:29.565
It could blow up any minute.

00:28:33.402 --> 00:28:34.695
It could blow up any minute.

00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:36.488
- Cassie!
- It could blow up any minute.

00:28:38.115 --> 00:28:39.241
Cassie!

00:28:44.914 --> 00:28:46.790
This place has
always been a death trap.

00:28:46.874 --> 00:28:48.626
- I got you, man.
- Come on. This way. Get her out.

00:28:48.709 --> 00:28:49.710
Otherwise stable.

00:28:49.793 --> 00:28:51.879
Wait, wait, wait.
Check his abdomen.

00:28:53.005 --> 00:28:55.674
And internal injuries.
Good catch.

00:28:55.758 --> 00:28:56.759
Let's go. Come on.

00:29:02.014 --> 00:29:03.182
I gotta get my guys in there.

00:29:03.265 --> 00:29:04.350
The structure's unstable.

00:29:04.433 --> 00:29:05.559
Hey, the people are trapped.

00:29:05.643 --> 00:29:07.770
The place is
packed with explosives.

00:29:07.853 --> 00:29:09.188
Industrial grade fireworks.

00:29:09.271 --> 00:29:10.606
This place has
always been a death trap.

00:29:10.689 --> 00:29:11.690
Cassie!

00:29:11.774 --> 00:29:12.983
Cassie! Cassie.

00:29:13.067 --> 00:29:14.735
I need you at the triage.

00:29:14.818 --> 00:29:16.362
- Come down to the staging area.
- We're ready to go.

00:29:16.445 --> 00:29:18.280
Sir, you're okay. You're okay.

00:29:18.364 --> 00:29:20.199
He's stable. Ready to transport.

00:29:20.282 --> 00:29:21.992
Yeah, copy that. We need
every able body down here.

00:29:22.076 --> 00:29:23.077
You're gonna be okay.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.787
Stabilise the head while
I get the longboard set up.

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:26.872
- Yeah. I'll give you a hand.
- Wait. O'Neil!

00:29:26.956 --> 00:29:28.123
Copy that.

00:29:28.207 --> 00:29:29.375
Hey, what is it? I gotta roll.

00:29:29.458 --> 00:29:31.001
Will you let me drive?

00:29:31.085 --> 00:29:32.169
What are you talking about?

00:29:32.878 --> 00:29:35.130
I don't know.
I just have a weird feeling.

00:29:35.214 --> 00:29:36.465
Cassie, I need you over here.

00:29:37.591 --> 00:29:39.093
Will you just let me drive?

00:29:39.176 --> 00:29:41.262
Look, you had
a bad experience on the job.

00:29:42.513 --> 00:29:43.973
I don't think
that's what's happening.

00:29:46.267 --> 00:29:47.810
Don't let it
mess with your head.

00:29:48.644 --> 00:29:49.937
Cassie, come on!

00:29:59.113 --> 00:30:01.115
This is O'Neil.
Clear of dock side.

00:30:01.198 --> 00:30:02.199
Headed back...

00:30:26.724 --> 00:30:28.350
O'Neil, come on.

00:30:32.438 --> 00:30:33.939
Come on. O'Neil.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.441
Come on!

00:30:37.026 --> 00:30:38.527
Let's get it! Come on, let's go!

00:30:39.778 --> 00:30:40.779
Wake up!

00:30:41.655 --> 00:30:43.157
O'Neil, come on.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.950
Did you see a white light or...

00:30:45.034 --> 00:30:46.327
O'Neil, come on.

00:30:47.369 --> 00:30:48.954
Cassie! Cassie!

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.167
Come on. Come back.

00:30:54.376 --> 00:30:55.961
Come on, come on.

00:30:56.754 --> 00:30:58.672
- Ben, help me.
- Cassie, Cassie, it's okay.

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:00.799
It's all right. It's okay.

00:31:01.467 --> 00:31:03.677
It's okay. Okay?

00:31:03.761 --> 00:31:06.096
There's nothing
you could have done. Okay?

00:31:43.217 --> 00:31:45.719
So, was it worth the trouble?

00:31:45.803 --> 00:31:47.263
The scale
of the NSA surveillance

00:31:47.346 --> 00:31:48.722
is unprecedented.

00:31:48.806 --> 00:31:50.516
They can access everything.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.310
There's nowhere to hide.

00:31:53.394 --> 00:31:54.645
That's the idea.

00:31:54.728 --> 00:31:56.897
The potential is infinite.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.108
It's intoxicating.

00:32:00.526 --> 00:32:02.528
But, in the wrong hands,
I mean...

00:32:03.404 --> 00:32:05.155
people can be tracked
wherever they go.

00:32:05.239 --> 00:32:06.949
It's gonna change everything.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:11.078
As long as it has the ability
to find those women now...

00:32:11.161 --> 00:32:13.163
before they get their powers.

00:32:13.247 --> 00:32:15.040
This is what
they look like in your visions

00:32:15.124 --> 00:32:16.458
as well as you can recollect.

00:32:17.042 --> 00:32:19.962
Their faces have been
taunting me for years.

00:32:20.045 --> 00:32:22.256
We don't know exactly
when your vision takes place...

00:32:22.339 --> 00:32:25.634
so I'm giving us
a 10-year range just to be safe.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.637
Here's what
they should look like now.

00:32:33.809 --> 00:32:35.144
They're younger than I thought.

00:32:37.062 --> 00:32:38.689
I didn't know
we'd be targeting teenagers.

00:32:38.772 --> 00:32:41.525
They're teenagers now,
but in the future...

00:32:41.609 --> 00:32:44.278
they have powers,
and they will try to destroy me.

00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:46.697
I came from nothing,
less than nothing.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.366
I will not give up
everything I've built...

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:51.076
and have my life cut short.

00:32:52.494 --> 00:32:55.915
Well, if they ride
public transportation...

00:32:55.998 --> 00:32:57.374
go to a museum...

00:32:57.458 --> 00:32:59.001
get money from an ATM...

00:32:59.793 --> 00:33:01.086
wherever they are
in the world...

00:33:02.379 --> 00:33:03.380
Find them.

00:33:04.298 --> 00:33:05.591
I pay you a fortune.

00:33:06.175 --> 00:33:07.301
Yeah, I'll find them.

00:33:10.679 --> 00:33:12.139
Still no blurriness.

00:33:12.223 --> 00:33:13.807
No double vision.

00:33:13.891 --> 00:33:15.017
No discolouration at all.

00:33:16.852 --> 00:33:18.312
Your eyesight is good,

00:33:18.395 --> 00:33:20.147
and all your other vitals
check out.

00:33:22.399 --> 00:33:23.817
But what about the visions?

00:33:24.693 --> 00:33:26.820
How am I seeing that stuff?

00:33:27.321 --> 00:33:29.490
Sometimes when
we experience trauma,

00:33:29.573 --> 00:33:31.033
it can have a lasting effect.

00:33:31.116 --> 00:33:32.952
This isn't trauma.

00:33:33.035 --> 00:33:34.745
I knew he was gonna die.

00:33:36.121 --> 00:33:37.206
I saw it.

00:33:37.289 --> 00:33:38.999
Cassie, I have
all your reports here

00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:40.543
from your other consultations.

00:33:41.252 --> 00:33:44.421
Your head CT was normal.
Your MRI was clear.

00:33:44.505 --> 00:33:45.965
The scan showed
no abnormalities.

00:33:46.048 --> 00:33:47.800
I know that it sounds crazy,
I know,

00:33:47.883 --> 00:33:49.760
but I don't understand
what's happening.

00:33:49.843 --> 00:33:52.012
I will be recommending
that you take a week off.

00:33:52.096 --> 00:33:53.472
Get some rest.

00:33:53.556 --> 00:33:54.640
Watch old movies.

00:33:55.349 --> 00:33:56.350
If you still have concerns,

00:33:56.433 --> 00:33:58.561
I can run some bloods
or refer you to psych.

00:33:58.936 --> 00:33:59.937
But I'm sure

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.814
everything will be back
to normal before you know it.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.111
I am in the presence

00:34:07.194 --> 00:34:08.863
of the Spirit of Christmas
Yet-to-Come.

00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:12.575
And you're going to show me
shadows of things

00:34:12.658 --> 00:34:14.869
that have not yet happened
but will happen.

00:34:16.786 --> 00:34:17.788
Spirit of the Future,

00:34:17.872 --> 00:34:20.082
I fear you more than
any other spectre I've seen.

00:34:20.748 --> 00:34:24.044
But even in my fear,
I must tell you, I am too old.

00:34:24.295 --> 00:34:25.504
I cannot change.

00:34:25.587 --> 00:34:27.297
Whose funeral
were they talking about?

00:34:31.886 --> 00:34:34.388
Hey, Cass, it's me again. Ben.

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.765
I know you're there.
Just pick up.

00:34:37.391 --> 00:34:38.517
I ought to be there
this time of day.

00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:43.105
Okay, well, O'Neil's funeral
starts at 2:00 in Poughkeepsie.

00:34:43.188 --> 00:34:44.398
Everyone's going.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.610
I know it's the last place
you wanna be...

00:34:47.692 --> 00:34:50.738
but it would help Susan
if you came.

00:34:50.821 --> 00:34:52.698
It might help you too.

00:34:52.781 --> 00:34:54.700
Look, if you leave now,
you can still make it.

00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:56.911
Cassie?

00:34:58.204 --> 00:34:59.205
Cass?

00:35:06.295 --> 00:35:07.796
Before I draw
nearer to that stone,

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.131
answer me one question.

00:35:09.715 --> 00:35:12.009
Are these the shadows
of things that must be...

00:35:13.135 --> 00:35:15.638
or are they only shadows
of things that might be?

00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:17.431
Hate to break it to you,
Scrooge...

00:35:18.849 --> 00:35:21.018
but you can't change anything.

00:35:57.346 --> 00:35:59.890
Are these the shadows of things
that must be?

00:36:00.641 --> 00:36:03.185
Or are they only shadows
of things that might be?

00:36:10.985 --> 00:36:12.903
This isn't gonna
change anything.

00:36:35.885 --> 00:36:37.511
Guess you didn't die after all.

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:07.750
Please keep all
personal belongings with you

00:37:07.833 --> 00:37:08.876
throughout your trip.

00:37:12.796 --> 00:37:14.256
Come on, guys. This way.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:16.008
Come on. Let's go down the ramp.

00:37:16.091 --> 00:37:17.176
Yeah, awesome.

00:37:33.609 --> 00:37:35.402
Can I have one
to Poughkeepsie, please?

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:39.073
...New Haven now ready.
Track 25. All aboard.

00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:40.866
Please keep all
personal belongings with you

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:42.076
throughout your trip.

00:37:42.159 --> 00:37:44.662
Anya Corazón is now moving
onto the platform.

00:37:45.412 --> 00:37:46.872
She's on her own.

00:37:48.165 --> 00:37:51.961
Julia Cornwall is
on the concourse, also alone.

00:37:52.336 --> 00:37:54.338
...find a member
of the MTA staff.

00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:57.383
And Martha Franklin.

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:00.803
Shit.

00:38:00.886 --> 00:38:01.887
What are the odds of them

00:38:01.971 --> 00:38:03.514
all being in the same place
at the same time?

00:38:03.597 --> 00:38:04.974
It's not a coincidence.

00:38:05.766 --> 00:38:07.768
There must be something
that connects them.

00:38:07.851 --> 00:38:08.978
Or...

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:11.647
something that will.

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:14.608
Please keep all belongings
with you at all times.

00:38:14.692 --> 00:38:19.029
If you see something suspicious,
find a member of the MTA staff.

00:38:19.113 --> 00:38:22.408
- Just on the lower level?
- Oh, sorry.

00:38:26.078 --> 00:38:29.498
Train to New Haven now ready.
Track 25.

00:38:30.124 --> 00:38:31.375
All aboard.

00:38:44.138 --> 00:38:46.807
New York City is a whole
new level of crazy these days.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:56.025
Please keep all belongings
with you at all times.

00:38:56.108 --> 00:38:58.777
If you see something suspicious,
find a member of the...

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.583
So this is two case studies?

00:39:21.467 --> 00:39:24.929
Train to New Haven now ready.
Track 25.

00:39:25.554 --> 00:39:26.639
All aboard.

00:39:43.989 --> 00:39:47.243
All right. Well, sit there,
and I'll take this seat.

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:06.262
Train to New Haven now ready.
Track 25.

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:07.888
All aboard.

00:40:09.515 --> 00:40:11.225
This is the train
to Mount Vernon, right?

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:23.696
Oh, my God.

00:40:24.029 --> 00:40:26.907
Train to New Haven now ready.
Track 25.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.535
- Is this real?
- All aboard.

00:40:30.536 --> 00:40:31.704
Are you okay, dear?

00:40:32.538 --> 00:40:34.915
Oh, God,
I think I'm going crazy.

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:37.418
New York City is a whole
new level of crazy these days.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.554
This is the train
to Mount Vernon, right?

00:40:50.556 --> 00:40:52.057
I hope not.

00:40:52.141 --> 00:40:53.142
Mount Vernon train

00:40:53.225 --> 00:40:54.852
will be leaving
in three minutes, Track 8.

00:40:55.644 --> 00:40:58.439
Hey, get back.
Yeah, they're coming your way.

00:41:16.665 --> 00:41:18.876
...all belongings
with you at all times.

00:41:18.959 --> 00:41:23.255
If you see something suspicious,
find a member of the MTA staff.

00:41:30.471 --> 00:41:32.806
Get up! Get off! Get off!

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:33.891
- Get up!
- Me?

00:41:33.974 --> 00:41:36.143
Go! Get off! You're gonna die
if you stay here!

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:38.604
{\an8}- Get up!
- We are? Are you threatening us?

00:41:38.687 --> 00:41:40.105
This is an emergency situation.

00:41:40.189 --> 00:41:41.815
I need you
to follow my instructions.

00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:43.692
Get off the train.
Come on.

00:41:43.776 --> 00:41:45.528
My mom told me
never to talk to strangers.

00:41:45.611 --> 00:41:47.613
- Get up!
- Hey, give me that back!

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.115
Hey, give me that back!

00:41:52.618 --> 00:41:54.703
I am so pressing charges.

00:41:55.079 --> 00:41:56.830
Okay, knock yourself out.

00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:58.624
Give me
my freaking skateboard back.

00:42:14.723 --> 00:42:15.849
Let's go.

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:20.271
What? No.

00:42:21.438 --> 00:42:22.648
Okay, never mind.

00:42:23.816 --> 00:42:24.984
Give me
my freaking skateboard back.

00:42:25.067 --> 00:42:26.068
Okay...

00:42:26.151 --> 00:42:27.945
- What exactly is this emergency?
- Well...

00:42:28.028 --> 00:42:29.780
This woman's
trying to abduct us!

00:42:29.864 --> 00:42:31.282
What?
No, that's not... That's...

00:42:31.365 --> 00:42:32.449
Shh. That's...

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.371
That's your emergency. That.

00:42:45.254 --> 00:42:46.881
Is anybody else seeing this?

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:48.591
- That man is trying to kill you.
- And how do you...

00:42:48.674 --> 00:42:49.884
- Why?
- I don't know. Come on.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.263
We don't have
tickets for this train.

00:42:54.346 --> 00:42:55.681
That's your biggest concern?

00:42:55.764 --> 00:42:58.183
Please stand clear
of the closing doors.

00:42:58.267 --> 00:42:59.602
This train is departing.

00:42:59.685 --> 00:43:01.979
Please be kind. Remove your bags
from the empty seats.

00:43:02.062 --> 00:43:04.190
Place them
in the luggage rack above.

00:43:04.857 --> 00:43:05.858
Come on.

00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:14.992
Okay.

00:43:15.784 --> 00:43:17.745
Hey, am I on the right train?

00:43:17.828 --> 00:43:19.371
I don't know, man.

00:43:19.788 --> 00:43:21.081
Please have all tickets ready.

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:23.626
This is Metro North to North...
Hey, what are you doing?

00:43:23.709 --> 00:43:25.085
No! Help!

00:43:32.593 --> 00:43:33.886
Holy shit.

00:43:33.969 --> 00:43:34.970
Come on.

00:43:43.312 --> 00:43:44.313
Go.

00:43:46.732 --> 00:43:47.733
Run!

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.370
There's an emergency exit
to the street that way.

00:43:59.453 --> 00:44:00.663
Go.

00:44:00.746 --> 00:44:02.164
Hey, help. Over here.

00:44:02.248 --> 00:44:03.457
I've never been so happy
to see cops.

00:44:03.541 --> 00:44:04.667
You guys
need to call for backup.

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.752
That will not be necessary
as long as you cooperate.

00:44:06.835 --> 00:44:07.836
Wait. What?
No, it's not for me. Ow.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.921
No. You don't understand.

00:44:09.004 --> 00:44:10.589
- Don't worry, don't worry. Calm down.
- We're being attacked. We're being attacked.

00:44:10.673 --> 00:44:11.840
You're safe.

00:44:13.133 --> 00:44:14.343
Run! Go!

00:44:14.843 --> 00:44:15.844
Run!

00:44:20.849 --> 00:44:22.351
Run! Run!

00:44:22.434 --> 00:44:23.769
Go! Go! Go!

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.461
Come on.

00:44:53.591 --> 00:44:54.592
- Get in.
- What?

00:44:54.675 --> 00:44:55.676
- Here you go. Thank you so much.
- Get in.

00:44:55.759 --> 00:44:56.760
Thank you so much.
This is for you.

00:44:56.844 --> 00:44:57.970
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Move. Slide over.

00:44:58.053 --> 00:44:59.680
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:02.516
Oh, wow, thank...
Hey!

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.810
That guy was nuts. Do you guys
think he killed those cops?

00:45:04.894 --> 00:45:06.604
He could climb on walls
and dodge bullets.

00:45:06.687 --> 00:45:08.439
- How is that even possible?
- It's not.

00:45:08.522 --> 00:45:09.773
There's not enough
frictional force

00:45:09.857 --> 00:45:11.275
in the bare human foot
to overcome gravity...

00:45:11.358 --> 00:45:12.359
and keep him
stuck to the wall...

00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:14.403
- What the hell is going on?
- ...much less the ceiling.

00:45:14.486 --> 00:45:15.863
Yeah, well,
science didn't seem to stop him,

00:45:15.946 --> 00:45:16.947
so what good is it?

00:45:17.031 --> 00:45:19.116
- What good is science?
- Okay, enough.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.743
- Please, don't fight.
- Enough.

00:45:20.826 --> 00:45:22.745
- No, I was just telling them...
- Enough!

00:45:22.828 --> 00:45:23.871
Your voices are, like,

00:45:23.954 --> 00:45:25.581
drilling in the centre
of my skull...

00:45:25.664 --> 00:45:26.665
and I need to think.

00:45:33.339 --> 00:45:35.216
I'm Cassie. Okay?

00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:36.342
What are your names?

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:38.260
What are your names?

00:45:38.344 --> 00:45:39.386
I'm Julia Cornwall.

00:45:40.512 --> 00:45:41.889
My dad lives here in New York,

00:45:41.972 --> 00:45:43.224
and my mom lives
back in LA, but...

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:44.850
We don't need
your whole life story.

00:45:46.852 --> 00:45:48.938
I'm Anya Corazón.

00:45:49.605 --> 00:45:50.606
Mattie Franklin.

00:45:51.357 --> 00:45:52.942
- Thank you for protecting us.
- No, no, no.

00:45:53.025 --> 00:45:54.026
I'm not... That's not...

00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:55.569
That's not
what's happening here.

00:45:55.653 --> 00:45:58.364
I'm not protecting you.
I am, I am...

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:00.407
Your parents can handle this.

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:02.159
My parents
are on a business trip.

00:46:02.243 --> 00:46:03.953
Yeah.
My parents are out of town too.

00:46:04.036 --> 00:46:06.288
- My dad is busy working, so...
- Oh, my God.

00:46:06.372 --> 00:46:07.540
I was gonna go
stay with some friends.

00:46:07.623 --> 00:46:08.999
Well, where do
your friends live?

00:46:09.083 --> 00:46:10.084
- I'll drop you off first.
- ...are asking

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:12.253
for the public's help...
in finding a person of interest

00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:15.381
seen in the attack
on multiple NYPD officers...

00:46:15.464 --> 00:46:16.966
at Grand Central Terminal
this afternoon.

00:46:17.049 --> 00:46:18.968
That's great. Good.

00:46:19.051 --> 00:46:22.680
I hope they find his crazy ass.
That was insane.

00:46:22.763 --> 00:46:24.807
They better lock him up.
Right? I mean...

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:26.183
She is also the same person

00:46:26.267 --> 00:46:27.309
police are
seeking to question...

00:46:27.393 --> 00:46:28.394
in the possible abduction...

00:46:28.477 --> 00:46:30.479
- She?
- ...of the three teenage girls.

00:46:30.563 --> 00:46:33.315
Eyewitnesses have identified
the woman in her early 30s.

00:46:33.399 --> 00:46:34.775
The public has been asked
for any information...

00:46:34.859 --> 00:46:35.860
What?

00:46:35.943 --> 00:46:37.069
...and to keep an eye out
for these girls.

00:46:37.152 --> 00:46:39.989
What? That's...
But you guys... What about them?

00:46:40.072 --> 00:46:41.115
And he was
crawling on the ceiling.

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:42.199
What about that guy?

00:46:42.283 --> 00:46:43.784
I mean, you saw. I...

00:46:43.868 --> 00:46:44.994
No one saw ceiling guy.

00:46:45.077 --> 00:46:46.537
Everyone thinks
you're the kidnapper.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.038
Yeah, because
you told them I was.

00:46:48.122 --> 00:46:49.582
I didn't know
what was happening.

00:46:49.665 --> 00:46:50.791
Okay, guys.

00:46:51.417 --> 00:46:53.210
My uncle, Jonah, can totally
help us. I'm gonna call him.

00:46:53.294 --> 00:46:54.712
You have a phone?

00:46:54.795 --> 00:46:56.505
You know they can
track those nowadays, right?

00:46:56.589 --> 00:46:58.048
No, you can't...

00:46:58.132 --> 00:47:00.509
- Hey! You can't do that.
- She's right.

00:47:00.593 --> 00:47:01.802
It's okay.
Daddy will buy you a new one.

00:47:01.886 --> 00:47:03.053
What is your problem?

00:47:03.137 --> 00:47:04.138
- What do you mean?
- Please.

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:05.723
- I'm just trying to help.
- Okay.

00:47:05.806 --> 00:47:08.309
Anyone who wants to leave
can leave right now.

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:09.810
- Yo, watch out!
- Okay.

00:47:09.894 --> 00:47:11.312
- Wait.
- Lady, drive!

00:47:11.812 --> 00:47:14.148
Sorry.
No, you can't actually leave...

00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:16.192
because you guys
are the only ones

00:47:16.275 --> 00:47:17.735
that know
what actually happened.

00:47:21.822 --> 00:47:23.657
Okay, well, this is
what we're gonna do, okay?

00:47:23.741 --> 00:47:26.118
We're just gonna, like,
lay low for a little bit.

00:47:27.328 --> 00:47:28.329
And...

00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:30.748
I'll figure out
how to get out of this.

00:47:34.543 --> 00:47:35.544
You know...

00:47:38.047 --> 00:47:39.298
This is still not a kidnapping.

00:47:39.381 --> 00:47:40.841
Okay?

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.510
Feels like a kidnapping.

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.681
How did they get away?

00:47:47.765 --> 00:47:49.892
It's like
they knew I was coming.

00:47:49.975 --> 00:47:52.478
No hits at the train station,
bus depot,

00:47:52.561 --> 00:47:53.687
or any of the bridges.

00:47:54.772 --> 00:47:56.148
Wherever they went,
there aren't any cameras.

00:47:56.232 --> 00:47:58.400
The police don't have
this technology.

00:47:58.484 --> 00:48:01.612
You have access
to every camera in the city.

00:48:01.695 --> 00:48:02.696
We should be ahead of them.

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:06.325
I went to a lot of trouble
to steal you these tools.

00:48:06.408 --> 00:48:08.285
Use them better.

00:48:09.286 --> 00:48:10.788
I've always
wanted to be a Girl Scout.

00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:11.872
Of course you did.

00:48:13.123 --> 00:48:14.708
Anybody else starving?

00:48:14.792 --> 00:48:16.293
All I have is gum.

00:48:17.586 --> 00:48:20.506
Here. I found this
in the glove compartment.

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:22.883
Wait. That bag's
already been opened.

00:48:22.967 --> 00:48:24.134
We don't know
how long it's been in there.

00:48:24.218 --> 00:48:27.096
Okay, I hope you're
good at catching squirrels.

00:48:27.972 --> 00:48:30.599
Okay, so what's the deal
with ceiling guy?

00:48:30.683 --> 00:48:32.685
I told you, I don't know.

00:48:32.768 --> 00:48:34.061
I've never seen him before.

00:48:34.144 --> 00:48:35.145
Then how did you know
he was coming?

00:48:35.229 --> 00:48:36.230
Oh, my God.

00:48:36.313 --> 00:48:39.024
I'm kind of more interested
in why he's trying to kill us.

00:48:39.108 --> 00:48:41.318
I don't know.

00:48:41.402 --> 00:48:43.946
Crazy shit's been happening,
and I don't know why.

00:48:44.029 --> 00:48:45.990
Stop asking me. Okay?

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.075
Wait. You're the paramedic.

00:48:49.827 --> 00:48:50.870
You saved my stepmother,

00:48:50.953 --> 00:48:52.872
then you were
super awkward about it.

00:48:54.415 --> 00:48:57.543
That does sound like me.

00:48:57.626 --> 00:48:59.753
Wait. I recognise you too.

00:48:59.837 --> 00:49:01.046
What?

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:03.215
Yeah. You live in my building.

00:49:04.008 --> 00:49:05.968
You leave your junk mail
in the lobby...

00:49:06.051 --> 00:49:08.012
and then everybody else
has to clean it up for you.

00:49:08.095 --> 00:49:10.639
Okay. Well, there should be
a recycling bin there.

00:49:11.056 --> 00:49:12.433
You don't think this is weird?

00:49:13.475 --> 00:49:14.685
That we both know you?

00:49:14.768 --> 00:49:15.769
It's honestly, like,

00:49:15.853 --> 00:49:17.980
the least weird thing
that's happened all day.

00:49:21.609 --> 00:49:22.610
What?

00:49:25.112 --> 00:49:26.113
Total stranger.

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:28.741
No.

00:49:29.867 --> 00:49:30.993
You flipped me off.

00:49:31.744 --> 00:49:33.162
That's not really
narrowing it down much.

00:49:33.245 --> 00:49:34.955
You guys, this is so freaky.

00:49:35.289 --> 00:49:37.208
Who are you? What is going on?

00:49:39.668 --> 00:49:41.670
I can see the future.

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:44.131
Kind of.

00:49:50.137 --> 00:49:51.138
I mean...

00:49:52.765 --> 00:49:53.807
What the hell?

00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:55.893
See? She didn't see that coming.

00:49:56.685 --> 00:49:57.978
It doesn't work like that.

00:49:58.062 --> 00:50:00.231
You guys,
just give her a chance, please.

00:50:00.314 --> 00:50:02.399
Wait. When you were looking
into the future...

00:50:02.483 --> 00:50:04.401
did you see us...

00:50:04.818 --> 00:50:06.946
in the middle of nowhere
eating glove-compartment jerky?

00:50:07.029 --> 00:50:10.115
Okay, look. Believe me or don't.
I don't care.

00:50:10.199 --> 00:50:12.701
I didn't ask
to be doing this with you.

00:50:13.077 --> 00:50:14.954
And I didn't ask for this
to happen to me, either.

00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:18.499
Also, I'm pretty sure
I saved all of your lives.

00:50:19.124 --> 00:50:21.252
So, you're welcome.

00:50:23.504 --> 00:50:24.630
How does it work?

00:50:27.299 --> 00:50:28.551
It just happens.

00:50:28.634 --> 00:50:30.511
Can you do it now?

00:50:31.804 --> 00:50:33.222
I can't control it.

00:50:33.305 --> 00:50:36.267
You know the other guy can walk
on the ceiling, right?

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:37.810
No, he can't.

00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:40.729
He was using his hands.

00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:42.648
Why are you like this?

00:50:42.731 --> 00:50:45.067
I'm just saying
it was more of a crawl.

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:47.027
It was like a spider...

00:50:48.654 --> 00:50:49.655
person.

00:50:58.622 --> 00:51:01.458
I'm gonna be back
in a few hours.

00:51:03.127 --> 00:51:04.753
Where are you going?

00:51:04.837 --> 00:51:07.756
I need to check some things out
about all of this.

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:10.551
You can't just leave us here.

00:51:10.634 --> 00:51:12.803
We'll be okay, Julia.
We don't need a babysitter.

00:51:12.887 --> 00:51:14.763
Yeah, sure. Just three teenagers
alone in the woods.

00:51:14.847 --> 00:51:16.932
Definitely not the opening
of a horror film.

00:51:17.016 --> 00:51:19.143
You are way safer out here.

00:51:19.643 --> 00:51:23.856
Just, you know,
be like a Girl Scout girl.

00:51:23.939 --> 00:51:25.900
Be that. Just be that.

00:51:25.983 --> 00:51:28.068
Can you bring us
some sandwiches?

00:51:28.152 --> 00:51:29.153
Cassie.

00:51:31.864 --> 00:51:33.240
Can we trust you?

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:36.619
Three hours. Okay?

00:51:36.702 --> 00:51:39.872
Just stay here.
And don't do anything dumb.

00:51:44.293 --> 00:51:47.504
Seriously. Don't do dumb things.

00:51:50.591 --> 00:51:52.134
She was talking to you.

00:51:52.218 --> 00:51:54.303
Okay, well,
you're just a bitch, so...

00:52:01.602 --> 00:52:02.728
I know tae kwon do.

00:52:03.395 --> 00:52:04.396
You?

00:52:05.397 --> 00:52:07.566
Yeah, I had
a few rough years in school

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:08.943
when my parents were divorcing.

00:52:09.026 --> 00:52:12.321
So I wanted to feel like I could
fight back if I needed to.

00:52:17.701 --> 00:52:18.953
That's what I thought.

00:53:32.401 --> 00:53:33.777
One second, cat.

00:53:37.114 --> 00:53:38.282
Come on.

00:53:42.328 --> 00:53:44.788
Research on Amazonian spiders...

00:53:45.998 --> 00:53:48.751
peptides, more peptides.

00:53:48.834 --> 00:53:50.211
Come on. Where is it?

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:54.006
Spider people.

00:53:54.715 --> 00:53:56.217
Las Arañas.

00:53:57.885 --> 00:53:59.595
Have you ever heard
of Las Arañas?

00:54:01.305 --> 00:54:02.306
Me neither.

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.186
"According to local folklore...

00:54:08.646 --> 00:54:12.024
"they possess powers
derived from spider venom...

00:54:13.317 --> 00:54:16.946
"and are incredibly fast,
incredibly strong...

00:54:18.572 --> 00:54:20.241
"and they can
climb like spiders."

00:54:22.576 --> 00:54:23.911
Just like ceiling guy.

00:54:30.376 --> 00:54:31.877
How would you know...

00:54:31.961 --> 00:54:35.839
if you could climb a wall
if you've never tried?

00:54:52.773 --> 00:54:55.192
Okay, let's not
mention that to anybody.

00:55:03.701 --> 00:55:07.329
"Las Arañas are said to possess
a sixth sense...

00:55:07.872 --> 00:55:10.541
"as if they had the ability
to glimpse the future."

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:25.723
Oh, my God.

00:55:44.533 --> 00:55:45.868
Hey, who's got the jerky?

00:55:45.951 --> 00:55:46.952
You ate it all.

00:55:47.536 --> 00:55:49.288
I had, like, three pieces.

00:55:49.371 --> 00:55:51.498
- Out of five.
- You counted?

00:55:51.582 --> 00:55:53.542
You also ate all mine.

00:55:55.044 --> 00:55:57.588
- What's this?
- Stop.

00:55:57.671 --> 00:55:58.839
Stop. Just...

00:55:59.965 --> 00:56:00.966
Jeez.

00:56:02.968 --> 00:56:04.637
Okay, forget jerky.

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:08.015
Did you guys see that diner
like a half-mile down the road?

00:56:08.098 --> 00:56:09.475
Let's just go there
and get real food.

00:56:09.558 --> 00:56:11.977
- Cassie told us to stay here.
- Come on, Julia.

00:56:12.061 --> 00:56:13.187
She bailed on us.

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:15.397
We don't have any money, genius.

00:56:15.481 --> 00:56:17.233
Well, I have money, so...

00:56:17.942 --> 00:56:19.568
You have money
so we should do what you want?

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:21.278
You got something to say?

00:56:21.904 --> 00:56:24.782
You know,
I bet your dad is a senator

00:56:24.865 --> 00:56:26.450
and your mom
sits on the board at the Met.

00:56:26.534 --> 00:56:28.744
And you summer in the Hamptons
next to Martha Stewart.

00:56:28.827 --> 00:56:30.746
So sad about Martha Stewart.

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:35.543
My parents are in Beijing...

00:56:35.626 --> 00:56:36.877
where my dad
is raking in a ton of money

00:56:36.961 --> 00:56:38.879
for making plastics
that pollute the ocean...

00:56:38.963 --> 00:56:41.090
and my mom is spending it all
on hideous art.

00:56:41.173 --> 00:56:42.550
So...

00:56:42.633 --> 00:56:43.926
I talk to them on Mondays.

00:56:44.009 --> 00:56:45.135
So who do you live with?

00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:47.221
The housekeeper.

00:56:49.056 --> 00:56:51.058
Well, on the upside, no curfew.

00:56:52.142 --> 00:56:53.644
I bet you have
your own room at least.

00:56:54.436 --> 00:56:57.439
I live with my dad and his wife
and their kid.

00:56:57.523 --> 00:56:59.775
- What about your mom?
- She's...

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.528
not really around.

00:57:02.611 --> 00:57:03.904
She bailed on you?

00:57:04.864 --> 00:57:07.074
Right. So, diner?

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:10.202
We spend some of Mattie's
daddy's pollution money?

00:57:10.286 --> 00:57:11.287
Yay.

00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:13.455
I'm going to order
everything on the menu.

00:57:16.292 --> 00:57:17.459
Julia, you in?

00:57:19.128 --> 00:57:20.421
Hey.

00:57:20.504 --> 00:57:22.089
We have
to take care of ourselves.

00:57:29.597 --> 00:57:30.598
Yeah.

00:57:32.933 --> 00:57:33.934
You're right.

00:57:35.644 --> 00:57:36.770
Let's go do this.

00:57:39.023 --> 00:57:40.441
She's kind of cute
when she's mad.

00:57:40.524 --> 00:57:41.692
I heard that.

00:57:43.485 --> 00:57:45.821
You are making
the right decision, Julia.

00:57:45.905 --> 00:57:47.615
You will not like me
when I'm hangry.

00:57:48.324 --> 00:57:50.034
Who says we like you now?

00:57:50.117 --> 00:57:52.953
God! I knew
we shouldn't have done this.

00:57:57.583 --> 00:57:58.709
Shit.

00:57:58.792 --> 00:58:00.127
Do you think there's ticks?

00:58:02.004 --> 00:58:03.005
Can we walk

00:58:03.088 --> 00:58:04.715
- a little faster, please?
- Julia.

00:58:04.798 --> 00:58:06.634
You said this was a shortcut.

00:58:06.717 --> 00:58:08.844
Are we lost?
Do you know where you're going?

00:58:08.928 --> 00:58:11.222
- You know where you're going?
- Yeah. Actually, I do.

00:58:14.308 --> 00:58:15.309
Ow! Shit!

00:58:19.313 --> 00:58:21.565
Okay. Don't talk
to anybody except to order.

00:58:22.149 --> 00:58:23.150
We're in the middle of nowhere.

00:58:23.234 --> 00:58:24.568
No one's gonna
track us down here.

00:58:24.652 --> 00:58:26.362
Just don't make eye contact.

00:58:26.946 --> 00:58:28.614
I hope they have cherry pie.

00:58:39.542 --> 00:58:40.876
Let's sit at the bar.

00:58:47.967 --> 00:58:48.968
There you go.

00:58:50.469 --> 00:58:51.470
Here.

00:58:52.972 --> 00:58:54.139
Should we make a game plan?

00:58:54.223 --> 00:58:56.350
Eat first, strategise later.

00:58:59.061 --> 00:59:01.146
Okay. Here you go.

00:59:04.066 --> 00:59:05.067
Keep it coming.

00:59:06.193 --> 00:59:08.904
Let's just eat quickly
and then get out of here.

00:59:08.988 --> 00:59:10.447
Absolutely, great idea.

00:59:10.531 --> 00:59:11.532
Right after cherry pie.

00:59:12.783 --> 00:59:15.119
No. No cherry pie.

00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.790
Julia, tell me you agree
that we should get dessert.

00:59:21.709 --> 00:59:23.544
Yeah, whatever you guys
are arguing about...

00:59:23.627 --> 00:59:26.338
I'm sure you're both
making really good points.

00:59:26.422 --> 00:59:28.215
We have minestrone, we have clam
chowder, and we have tomato.

00:59:28.299 --> 00:59:29.633
- Watch out, watch out.
- Ooh, she's lookin' at you.

00:59:35.639 --> 00:59:37.391
We should go over there
and talk to them.

00:59:38.058 --> 00:59:39.059
Really?

00:59:40.185 --> 00:59:41.937
No. We...

00:59:42.021 --> 00:59:43.522
Should we? We can't.

00:59:43.606 --> 00:59:45.399
Come on. You know you want to.

00:59:45.482 --> 00:59:46.483
No.

00:59:46.567 --> 00:59:49.153
- This is not a good idea.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

00:59:49.236 --> 00:59:50.446
- What're you doing?
- Yeah, what are you doing?

00:59:50.529 --> 00:59:51.822
Just hold on a second.

00:59:51.906 --> 00:59:52.948
What is this?

00:59:53.032 --> 00:59:54.033
Do you want the Reuben?

00:59:55.326 --> 00:59:57.494
{\an8}It's just
a little confidence boost.

00:59:57.578 --> 00:59:59.205
This isn't really my style.

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:02.458
So what? You look cute. Come on.

01:00:02.541 --> 01:00:04.960
This is not a good idea.
Seriously, guys.

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:06.670
Okay.

01:00:06.754 --> 01:00:08.172
Hi. Hey, guys.

01:00:08.255 --> 01:00:09.965
- I'm Mattie. This is Julia.
- Oh, hey. Good.

01:00:10.049 --> 01:00:11.342
- Can we sit?
- Yeah, of course.

01:00:11.425 --> 01:00:12.843
We've been
saving these seats for you.

01:00:12.927 --> 01:00:14.053
Awesome.

01:00:15.054 --> 01:00:16.430
Oh, hey, what's up?
How you doin'?

01:00:16.513 --> 01:00:17.514
Nice to meet you too.

01:00:17.598 --> 01:00:18.599
...for your information.

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:20.392
Can you just
confirm your location?

01:00:20.476 --> 01:00:22.853
4 Star Diner.
Daves Road, Route 206.

01:00:22.937 --> 01:00:23.979
- Hey.
- Church Hill, New Jersey.

01:00:24.063 --> 01:00:26.190
Possible sighting
in Church Hill, New Jersey.

01:00:26.273 --> 01:00:28.275
Connect me with
the Church Hill police dispatch.

01:00:28.776 --> 01:00:30.194
Yeah. Patching you in now.

01:00:39.161 --> 01:00:42.873
2-2-3 dispatch.
On scene at 4 Star Diner.

01:00:42.957 --> 01:00:44.500
Route 206 at Daves Road.

01:00:44.583 --> 01:00:45.876
Go ahead, 2-2-3.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.378
No need to send backup.

01:00:49.797 --> 01:00:51.507
These aren't
our missing persons.

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:54.802
Code four. Repeat.

01:00:55.386 --> 01:00:57.263
These are not
our missing persons.

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:08.816
Girls!

01:01:18.409 --> 01:01:19.410
Girls!

01:01:24.039 --> 01:01:25.291
Oh, God damn it.

01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:44.310
Girls!

01:01:53.068 --> 01:01:54.653
Let's go. Let's go!

01:01:55.154 --> 01:01:56.864
Don't even pretend
that you're cooler than Britney.

01:01:56.947 --> 01:01:57.948
I know you know the words.

01:01:58.032 --> 01:01:59.950
- Come on, get up here.
- You should get up there.

01:02:00.034 --> 01:02:01.869
So much
for not attracting attention.

01:02:11.837 --> 01:02:13.672
No. Please. Please, stop.

01:02:13.756 --> 01:02:15.257
Don't touch me, okay?

01:02:15.341 --> 01:02:16.592
Can you...

01:02:16.675 --> 01:02:18.761
What are you doing?

01:02:18.844 --> 01:02:19.970
- What are you...
- What is that?

01:02:20.054 --> 01:02:21.388
We have to go.

01:02:25.059 --> 01:02:26.185
I'm so sorry.

01:02:29.021 --> 01:02:30.022
Get down!

01:02:31.398 --> 01:02:32.983
- This isn't what you think.
- Get your stuff.

01:02:33.067 --> 01:02:34.109
You left us.

01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:36.779
I'm so sorry.

01:02:39.532 --> 01:02:40.783
Julia!

01:02:40.866 --> 01:02:41.867
Julia!

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:43.994
Julia, get back!

01:02:55.256 --> 01:02:56.257
Come on!

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.466
No! Mattie!

01:02:58.592 --> 01:02:59.593
No.

01:03:46.682 --> 01:03:48.475
This track is going to be huge.

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:50.769
Are you in the zone?
This is Britney Spears.

01:03:53.981 --> 01:03:55.649
Let's try that again.

01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:08.871
I love this song.

01:04:12.374 --> 01:04:13.375
Guys.

01:04:13.876 --> 01:04:16.170
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I have to dance.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.676
- Come on, Julia.
- Mattie, no.

01:04:23.719 --> 01:04:25.179
Right. Okay.

01:04:33.979 --> 01:04:35.272
Oh, my God. Come on.

01:04:39.193 --> 01:04:40.611
Seriously, dude.

01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:52.915
Come on. Let's go.

01:04:52.998 --> 01:04:54.833
Don't even pretend
that you're cooler than Britney.

01:04:54.917 --> 01:04:55.960
I know you know the words.

01:04:56.043 --> 01:04:57.836
Come on, get up here.

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:00.214
Hey!

01:05:00.297 --> 01:05:01.549
You should totally
get up there, dog.

01:05:02.341 --> 01:05:03.342
Come on.

01:05:12.768 --> 01:05:14.436
Hey!

01:05:18.566 --> 01:05:20.484
Guys. Guys, guys.
We have to go, we have to...

01:05:29.243 --> 01:05:30.911
Girls, get in! Get in! Get in!

01:05:30.995 --> 01:05:32.454
Leave everything. Run!

01:05:33.247 --> 01:05:34.957
- Come on, let's go. Let's go!
- Mattie, come on!

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.667
- Get in!
- I'm so sorry, Cassie.

01:05:55.311 --> 01:05:56.395
God!

01:05:59.190 --> 01:06:00.983
So much
for not needing a babysitter.

01:06:01.066 --> 01:06:03.319
Do you guys think of anybody
but yourselves?

01:06:03.402 --> 01:06:05.446
You're so impulsive
and entitled,

01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:06.530
and you don't listen!

01:06:06.614 --> 01:06:07.907
- We didn't mean to...
- Whatever!

01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:09.074
Don't even say anything!

01:06:09.909 --> 01:06:10.910
God!

01:06:11.493 --> 01:06:13.204
Your futures were almost...

01:06:13.996 --> 01:06:15.122
so different.

01:06:16.999 --> 01:06:18.709
You're lucky I saw them.

01:06:18.792 --> 01:06:19.919
I'm so sorry.

01:06:20.002 --> 01:06:21.003
Yes.

01:06:21.921 --> 01:06:25.090
You should be so sorry.
All of you should be sorry.

01:06:27.426 --> 01:06:28.427
God!

01:06:51.867 --> 01:06:53.869
Amaria, where did they go?

01:06:53.953 --> 01:06:55.746
I'm running checks now.

01:06:56.956 --> 01:06:58.749
I don't understand
how they're doing this.

01:06:58.832 --> 01:07:00.543
I've got a match on the woman
who's with them.

01:07:00.918 --> 01:07:02.336
I'm not interested in her.

01:07:02.836 --> 01:07:04.672
Focus on finding those girls.

01:07:04.755 --> 01:07:06.006
Cassandra Webb.

01:07:06.924 --> 01:07:08.926
Daughter of Constance Webb, deceased.

01:07:09.385 --> 01:07:10.678
Did you say, "Webb"?

01:07:12.054 --> 01:07:13.472
Yeah. Do you know her?

01:07:13.556 --> 01:07:14.974
That's not possible.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.561
Come on.

01:07:22.857 --> 01:07:25.317
He's not gonna stop
until he kills us, is he?

01:07:26.485 --> 01:07:29.280
I don't know what he wants.
I don't know anything.

01:07:31.156 --> 01:07:33.075
But you can see the future.

01:07:33.993 --> 01:07:36.495
Can't you stop him
with your visions?

01:07:36.579 --> 01:07:38.414
I don't know
how to control them.

01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:40.499
It's useless.

01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:42.376
Well, we're alive.
Maybe that's a plus.

01:07:42.835 --> 01:07:43.836
Is your hand okay?

01:07:45.588 --> 01:07:46.589
It's fine.

01:07:51.719 --> 01:07:53.721
First thing in the morning,
I'm taking you all home.

01:07:54.096 --> 01:07:55.514
Your parents can deal with this.

01:07:56.891 --> 01:07:58.017
No, they can't.

01:08:02.021 --> 01:08:03.314
My mom's in a psych ward.

01:08:05.691 --> 01:08:07.443
She didn't really cope well
after my dad left...

01:08:07.526 --> 01:08:10.237
and so, I got sent to live
with him and his new family...

01:08:10.321 --> 01:08:12.031
and I don't think
that they want me there.

01:08:15.534 --> 01:08:17.243
I wondered if they missed me...

01:08:18.954 --> 01:08:20.164
if I ran away.

01:08:21.916 --> 01:08:22.917
So you did.

01:08:23.626 --> 01:08:24.960
My parents aren't around either.

01:08:25.544 --> 01:08:28.255
I think they resent how having
a kid messed up their lives.

01:08:28.839 --> 01:08:29.840
I don't think they're gonna

01:08:29.924 --> 01:08:31.258
fly back from China
to deal with this.

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:33.344
And I really
don't wanna find out, so...

01:08:34.053 --> 01:08:35.054
I'm on my own.

01:08:37.932 --> 01:08:39.934
Well, fine.
Then you guys can just...

01:08:41.268 --> 01:08:42.937
- go to the police.
- No.

01:08:46.482 --> 01:08:49.151
My dad got deported
six months ago.

01:08:50.277 --> 01:08:52.446
I came home from school,
and he was gone.

01:08:52.863 --> 01:08:53.988
What about your mom?

01:08:54.073 --> 01:08:55.866
My mom died when I was five.

01:08:56.533 --> 01:08:57.535
It's just me and my dad.

01:08:58.661 --> 01:09:00.412
Except he never told me
he didn't have his papers.

01:09:00.496 --> 01:09:02.414
So, I've just been
living by myself

01:09:02.497 --> 01:09:03.666
at our apartment since then.

01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:04.750
You're on your own?

01:09:06.085 --> 01:09:08.461
I don't need anyone else
to look out for me.

01:09:10.589 --> 01:09:11.881
And I don't
have a curfew, either.

01:09:15.301 --> 01:09:17.220
So, I can't go to the police.

01:09:17.304 --> 01:09:18.305
Okay?

01:09:18.805 --> 01:09:21.183
Until I'm 18, I can't exist.

01:09:22.684 --> 01:09:24.812
And there's no way
I'm getting deported too.

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:27.231
Or going into the foster system.

01:09:30.109 --> 01:09:31.109
Well...

01:09:32.403 --> 01:09:34.988
Foster system
isn't always that terrible.

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:40.493
Things didn't turn out
so bad for me.

01:09:41.036 --> 01:09:42.037
Right.

01:09:45.416 --> 01:09:46.834
Cassie, please help us.

01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:11.604
No one survives once enough
poison enters their system.

01:12:11.687 --> 01:12:13.564
You won't be so lucky next time.

01:12:14.273 --> 01:12:15.900
Why are you doing this?

01:12:16.775 --> 01:12:18.694
I need to stop them
from killing me.

01:12:19.737 --> 01:12:22.323
They're not killers.
They're just teenagers.

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:24.575
In the future,
they become much more.

01:12:24.658 --> 01:12:28.871
In the future, they will destroy
me and everything I've built.

01:12:30.539 --> 01:12:32.082
Those girls cannot exist.

01:12:33.042 --> 01:12:34.585
How come you get to decide?

01:12:35.169 --> 01:12:37.046
Because I'm the one
with the powers.

01:12:40.883 --> 01:12:44.470
If you knew what I knew,
you'd do the same thing.

01:12:46.347 --> 01:12:47.514
Would I?

01:12:47.598 --> 01:12:50.809
If I knew the price to pay
was the lives of three girls?

01:12:50.893 --> 01:12:52.561
The only thing I know is that,

01:12:52.645 --> 01:12:54.855
in the future,
they also have powers.

01:12:56.899 --> 01:13:00.236
The girls? The girls have powers
in the future?

01:13:00.319 --> 01:13:02.571
Did you think you could beat me
with your mind?

01:13:03.614 --> 01:13:05.491
Your mother underestimated me.

01:13:07.409 --> 01:13:08.702
The power of the spider.

01:13:09.662 --> 01:13:11.580
Don't make the same mistake.

01:13:12.081 --> 01:13:13.165
Tell me where they are!

01:13:13.874 --> 01:13:15.084
They don't mean anything to you.

01:13:16.752 --> 01:13:18.170
You could just walk away.

01:14:13.934 --> 01:14:15.644
What is this?

01:14:20.024 --> 01:14:21.233
Rise and shine.

01:14:22.067 --> 01:14:24.278
Okay, so this guy's hands

01:14:24.361 --> 01:14:26.947
somehow release
an acute neurotoxin...

01:14:27.031 --> 01:14:29.575
and it is painful. I was lucky.

01:14:29.658 --> 01:14:31.202
The longer he holds on to you,

01:14:31.285 --> 01:14:33.370
the more poison
gets into your system.

01:14:33.454 --> 01:14:34.455
Then what happens?

01:14:35.873 --> 01:14:37.208
Then your heart stops.

01:14:38.792 --> 01:14:41.837
But you can offset
cardiac arrest with CPR.

01:14:42.463 --> 01:14:45.549
So you interlock your hands
like this.

01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:47.593
You lock your elbows...

01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:50.262
and then you place
the heel of your hand

01:14:50.346 --> 01:14:52.598
right on the sternum. Okay?

01:14:52.681 --> 01:14:53.682
And then you pump.

01:14:53.766 --> 01:14:56.018
And you wanna go,
like, two inches down.

01:14:56.393 --> 01:14:59.230
And you wanna keep
a rhythm like a heartbeat. Okay?

01:14:59.855 --> 01:15:00.940
You ready?

01:15:01.023 --> 01:15:03.150
Okay, begin compressions.
Go. Good.

01:15:05.194 --> 01:15:06.529
Okay. And when do I stop?

01:15:06.612 --> 01:15:08.364
You don't stop.
If you stop, they die.

01:15:09.657 --> 01:15:10.658
And if you get tired,

01:15:10.741 --> 01:15:12.368
then you need
somebody to take over.

01:15:13.202 --> 01:15:14.453
- I'm getting kinda tired.
- Okay.

01:15:14.537 --> 01:15:16.622
- Anya, get ready to take over.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:15:16.705 --> 01:15:19.583
But you have to pick up
the exact same rhythm.

01:15:19.667 --> 01:15:20.668
- Yeah.
- Ready?

01:15:20.751 --> 01:15:22.002
- Yep.
- And go.

01:15:25.339 --> 01:15:27.424
Great. Nice, Mattie.

01:15:27.508 --> 01:15:28.509
Not cool.

01:15:31.262 --> 01:15:33.097
Julia, you wanna take over?
Okay.

01:15:34.306 --> 01:15:35.307
Get ready.

01:15:37.434 --> 01:15:40.563
Okay. One, two, three. Perfect.

01:15:40.646 --> 01:15:41.939
Nice job, Anya.

01:15:44.441 --> 01:15:46.652
I've never said this before
in my entire life...

01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:48.737
but you're a good teacher.

01:15:51.031 --> 01:15:54.869
Well, I've been
learning some things too.

01:15:57.079 --> 01:15:58.372
About my mom.

01:16:05.170 --> 01:16:06.463
Wait, so you do know this guy.

01:16:07.172 --> 01:16:08.674
My mom did. I think.

01:16:08.757 --> 01:16:10.009
That's her.

01:16:10.092 --> 01:16:11.385
She's really pretty.

01:16:15.681 --> 01:16:17.516
So this is because of you?

01:16:19.894 --> 01:16:22.813
All I know is that
she was researching spiders.

01:16:23.772 --> 01:16:25.649
In her notebook,
there's some stuff...

01:16:25.733 --> 01:16:30.487
about a local tribe in Peru
that can do, like, crazy stuff.

01:16:30.571 --> 01:16:32.281
What kind of crazy stuff?

01:16:33.782 --> 01:16:35.659
Climb like spiders.

01:16:37.286 --> 01:16:39.997
So is he one of them?

01:16:40.789 --> 01:16:42.416
I need more information.

01:16:46.212 --> 01:16:47.213
You're leaving.

01:16:51.217 --> 01:16:53.427
I have to go and figure out
what is going on.

01:16:53.928 --> 01:16:54.929
How?

01:16:57.932 --> 01:16:59.308
You have to go to Peru.

01:17:02.770 --> 01:17:03.771
I'll be gone a week.

01:17:03.854 --> 01:17:04.855
I don't wanna leave them,

01:17:04.939 --> 01:17:06.273
but he's out there
looking for them...

01:17:06.357 --> 01:17:07.358
and they're relying on me,

01:17:07.441 --> 01:17:08.734
and I don't know how else
to protect them.

01:17:08.817 --> 01:17:11.111
Okay, look, I'm staying
with Mary for a few weeks

01:17:11.195 --> 01:17:12.321
while Richard's out of town.

01:17:12.404 --> 01:17:14.532
He won't find them there.
But, Cassie...

01:17:15.741 --> 01:17:18.452
I can't pretend to understand
what's going on here.

01:17:18.536 --> 01:17:20.913
Just be careful, okay?

01:17:20.996 --> 01:17:22.248
I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:17:22.331 --> 01:17:24.333
Thank you, Ben.
You didn't ask for any of this.

01:17:24.416 --> 01:17:26.252
Okay, well, neither did you.

01:19:53.065 --> 01:19:55.860
You have come back
looking for answers.

01:19:59.905 --> 01:20:00.906
Back?

01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:03.075
I promised your mother
I would be here.

01:20:06.537 --> 01:20:09.039
My mom thought
Las Arañas were a myth.

01:20:09.123 --> 01:20:10.332
What do you think?

01:20:10.416 --> 01:20:13.043
I think she was crazy
for coming here alone.

01:20:13.127 --> 01:20:14.545
She came here

01:20:14.628 --> 01:20:17.423
hoping to extract healing
properties from the spiders.

01:20:17.506 --> 01:20:19.550
She thought
she was being protected.

01:20:19.633 --> 01:20:20.843
By Ezekiel Sims?

01:20:20.926 --> 01:20:22.845
His motives were selfish.

01:20:22.928 --> 01:20:24.722
He used your mom to find us.

01:20:24.805 --> 01:20:26.432
But, because
he stole the spider...

01:20:26.515 --> 01:20:27.641
he was cursed.

01:20:28.434 --> 01:20:31.353
And he's been trying to outrun
his destiny ever since.

01:20:38.235 --> 01:20:39.862
This is where my mom died?

01:20:40.738 --> 01:20:42.364
And where you were born.

01:20:47.828 --> 01:20:51.123
I don't understand why
she risked my life to come here.

01:20:52.041 --> 01:20:54.251
To see the future clearly...

01:20:54.335 --> 01:20:56.545
you have
to heal the wounds of your past.

01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:57.671
That sounds like literally

01:20:57.755 --> 01:21:00.090
every therapy session
I've ever avoided.

01:21:00.174 --> 01:21:02.635
You have to go
back to your beginning

01:21:02.718 --> 01:21:04.011
and keep going past that.

01:21:04.094 --> 01:21:05.137
There are powers

01:21:05.221 --> 01:21:07.389
you don't even know
you're capable of.

01:21:08.557 --> 01:21:11.685
Your thread did not start
when you were born.

01:21:15.397 --> 01:21:16.565
Do you trust me?

01:21:18.984 --> 01:21:20.945
Not really sure at this point
I have a choice.

01:21:29.495 --> 01:21:30.829
You could just walk away.

01:21:30.913 --> 01:21:33.415
Your thread did not start
when you were born.

01:21:34.625 --> 01:21:36.585
They're almost
impossible to find.

01:21:37.419 --> 01:21:39.922
She really is trying her best
to keep me from working.

01:21:40.005 --> 01:21:41.215
Not when I'm this close.

01:21:41.298 --> 01:21:42.716
But I'm not
gonna let her do that.

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.885
Why did you hate me so much?

01:21:44.969 --> 01:21:45.970
Thank you.

01:21:46.053 --> 01:21:47.304
For the umbrella.

01:21:48.430 --> 01:21:49.723
- Give it to me.
- No.

01:21:50.307 --> 01:21:51.475
I found it.

01:21:51.559 --> 01:21:52.560
I found the spider.

01:21:53.435 --> 01:21:54.853
Incredible, isn't it?

01:21:56.939 --> 01:21:58.858
- Give it to me.
- No, please.

01:21:58.941 --> 01:21:59.942
Give it to me.

01:22:00.025 --> 01:22:01.026
You're making
the wrong decision.

01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:02.778
- You could just walk away.
- No, you're making the wrong...

01:22:15.666 --> 01:22:18.043
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm...

01:22:18.836 --> 01:22:21.505
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:22:23.507 --> 01:22:25.467
Las Arañas could not stand by.

01:22:26.176 --> 01:22:28.178
We tried to save you both.

01:22:46.071 --> 01:22:48.032
Her journey will not be easy...

01:22:48.866 --> 01:22:50.576
but she is strong.

01:22:59.585 --> 01:23:01.795
Your test results came back.

01:23:01.879 --> 01:23:02.963
I'm sorry to tell you

01:23:03.047 --> 01:23:05.633
that your baby has
myasthenia gravis.

01:23:05.716 --> 01:23:08.719
It's a genetic
neuromuscular disorder.

01:23:08.802 --> 01:23:10.512
But I don't have
a neuromuscular disorder.

01:23:10.596 --> 01:23:13.307
Life expectancy varies.

01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:15.142
Do you need a tissue?

01:23:15.226 --> 01:23:16.936
No. No. I need a cure.

01:23:17.019 --> 01:23:19.521
I'm afraid there is no cure.

01:23:19.939 --> 01:23:22.191
Single target
nucleotide intervention.

01:23:22.691 --> 01:23:24.109
It's experimental...

01:23:24.401 --> 01:23:26.612
but there are some promising
leads in the Amazon.

01:23:26.695 --> 01:23:28.322
That's why you went there?

01:23:28.822 --> 01:23:29.823
For me?

01:23:29.907 --> 01:23:32.326
I have to advise you against
travelling in your condition.

01:23:32.409 --> 01:23:35.412
I'm sorry, what are you offering
besides tissues?

01:23:35.496 --> 01:23:37.331
I know this is hard to accept.

01:23:37.414 --> 01:23:38.916
No, no, I am...

01:23:38.999 --> 01:23:43.003
I'm unwilling to accept
a diagnosis of helplessness.

01:23:44.129 --> 01:23:46.340
And I'm not gonna
teach my daughter to either.

01:23:55.975 --> 01:23:56.976
You did it.

01:23:58.852 --> 01:23:59.937
You did it.

01:24:01.438 --> 01:24:03.315
I never knew I was sick.

01:24:03.399 --> 01:24:06.527
The spider venom
did have healing properties.

01:24:09.446 --> 01:24:11.949
I'm so sorry I spent so long
being mad at you.

01:24:56.619 --> 01:24:58.871
I always thought my mom
didn't care about me.

01:24:59.622 --> 01:25:03.209
Sometimes you must sacrifice
yourself for those you love.

01:25:07.213 --> 01:25:09.506
I was there.
I was in the room...

01:25:10.216 --> 01:25:12.551
I was in the room with her.
How did you do that?

01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:14.011
You did that.

01:25:14.094 --> 01:25:17.056
Now you're starting to see
what you're capable of.

01:25:17.139 --> 01:25:20.142
You came here to learn the truth
about your past.

01:25:20.935 --> 01:25:23.270
But you will leave ready
to embrace your future.

01:25:25.022 --> 01:25:27.858
Seeing into the future
is no match for Ezekiel.

01:25:27.942 --> 01:25:30.945
I need to stop him
before he kills those girls.

01:25:31.028 --> 01:25:32.655
But I can't do what he can do.

01:25:32.738 --> 01:25:37.201
I can't do the leapy, crawly,
like, death poison.

01:25:37.284 --> 01:25:40.246
You didn't get the gift of
the greater physical strength...

01:25:40.329 --> 01:25:42.665
or the ability
to release poison...

01:25:42.748 --> 01:25:47.461
but seeing into the future
is only the start.

01:25:47.545 --> 01:25:50.256
Your mind
has infinite potential.

01:25:50.339 --> 01:25:53.676
If you master your power,
you can use the web...

01:25:53.759 --> 01:25:56.845
to be in more than one place
at the same time.

01:25:57.471 --> 01:26:00.641
You are the only one
who can change the future.

01:26:01.892 --> 01:26:04.311
And when you take on
the responsibility...

01:26:05.479 --> 01:26:07.690
great power will come.

01:26:24.957 --> 01:26:26.208
Every day that goes by,

01:26:26.292 --> 01:26:28.627
my appointment with death
gets closer.

01:26:29.962 --> 01:26:31.672
And you still
have found nothing?

01:26:32.256 --> 01:26:33.257
How can she have kept

01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:35.467
three teenagers
hidden for a week?

01:26:35.551 --> 01:26:37.386
I'm running checks
every three minutes,

01:26:37.469 --> 01:26:39.263
scanning CCTV camera.

01:26:39.346 --> 01:26:40.347
I have hacked

01:26:40.431 --> 01:26:42.182
police and emergency services
frequencies.

01:26:42.266 --> 01:26:44.184
I have eyes
on all of their houses,

01:26:44.268 --> 01:26:46.145
including friends and family.

01:26:48.063 --> 01:26:49.106
Still nothing.

01:26:49.190 --> 01:26:51.192
Do you understand?

01:26:52.484 --> 01:26:53.569
Huh?

01:26:53.652 --> 01:26:55.779
Those girls cannot exist.

01:26:55.863 --> 01:26:57.573
They will try to destroy me,

01:26:57.656 --> 01:27:00.367
as I will you
if you don't find them.

01:27:02.161 --> 01:27:03.579
She can't hide them forever.

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.211
Okay, it's still
pretty quiet out there.

01:27:11.086 --> 01:27:12.796
- What'd I miss?
- Ben said words.

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:14.632
- Oh, boring.
- Okay, let's try and remember

01:27:14.715 --> 01:27:15.716
- to pick up...
- Nice nails.

01:27:15.799 --> 01:27:16.926
- after ourselves. Okay, guys?
- Thank you.

01:27:17.009 --> 01:27:18.093
- Hey!
- I mean, this is really...

01:27:18.177 --> 01:27:19.220
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Rude!

01:27:19.303 --> 01:27:20.596
- All right, throwing popcorn...
- Guys?

01:27:20.679 --> 01:27:22.223
- is super fun.
- I cannot wait for that.

01:27:22.306 --> 01:27:24.099
- But I also think...
- Guys, either I peed myself...

01:27:24.183 --> 01:27:26.060
or my water broke.

01:27:28.437 --> 01:27:29.521
Ew!

01:27:29.605 --> 01:27:31.148
Well, honestly,
you probably peed yourself...

01:27:31.232 --> 01:27:32.983
because that isn't
supposed to happen yet.

01:27:33.067 --> 01:27:34.068
Richard's not here,

01:27:34.151 --> 01:27:36.862
and the baby
isn't due for four weeks.

01:27:36.946 --> 01:27:39.323
I don't think the baby
got the memo, Ben.

01:27:39.406 --> 01:27:40.616
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

01:27:41.033 --> 01:27:43.953
Looks like we may have to wait
a little while for...

01:27:45.162 --> 01:27:46.163
the ambulance.

01:27:46.247 --> 01:27:48.249
The baby is not waiting.

01:27:48.332 --> 01:27:50.543
He's coming now.

01:27:50.626 --> 01:27:51.627
Now.

01:27:52.461 --> 01:27:54.463
Like, here? In the dining room?

01:27:54.547 --> 01:27:57.258
If Ben doesn't get me
to the hospital, then yes.

01:27:57.341 --> 01:27:58.342
Okay.

01:28:00.678 --> 01:28:01.679
Get in the car.

01:28:05.349 --> 01:28:06.350
Keep your head down.

01:28:10.771 --> 01:28:11.772
It's gonna be okay.

01:28:13.065 --> 01:28:14.066
Okay. Come on.

01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:15.150
Okay, okay.

01:28:18.112 --> 01:28:19.113
Everyone okay?

01:28:19.572 --> 01:28:21.073
Okay, seat belts, everybody.

01:28:21.657 --> 01:28:22.658
Seriously?

01:28:23.367 --> 01:28:24.493
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

01:28:24.577 --> 01:28:25.703
Never mind.

01:28:29.665 --> 01:28:31.584
All right, let's step on it.

01:28:49.518 --> 01:28:51.353
10-58 in progress. 30-relo-5.

01:28:51.437 --> 01:28:52.438
I might have something.

01:28:52.521 --> 01:28:53.689
Woman in labour.

01:28:54.899 --> 01:28:56.442
20-Edward copy. En route.

01:28:56.525 --> 01:28:57.693
- 13-Edward, go ahead.
- 10-4.

01:28:57.776 --> 01:28:58.819
Possible D&D in progress.

01:29:00.529 --> 01:29:02.364
I've intercepted
a call to the hospital.

01:29:02.448 --> 01:29:03.449
St Timothy's.

01:29:03.532 --> 01:29:04.700
Track the route.

01:29:04.783 --> 01:29:05.784
Tracking.

01:29:43.822 --> 01:29:44.823
The baby is not waiting.

01:29:44.907 --> 01:29:46.492
...doesn't get me
to the hospital, then...

01:29:46.575 --> 01:29:47.576
Get out, get out, get out!

01:29:47.660 --> 01:29:48.953
- Go, go, go!
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

01:29:49.328 --> 01:29:50.329
What? What?

01:29:50.955 --> 01:29:52.122
Mattie, Mattie, Mattie!

01:29:52.206 --> 01:29:53.207
Shit!

01:30:05.177 --> 01:30:06.387
Sorry, guys.

01:30:09.598 --> 01:30:10.599
Hey!

01:30:14.895 --> 01:30:16.230
Thank you.

01:30:21.986 --> 01:30:23.195
So the last one was

01:30:23.279 --> 01:30:25.906
three minutes and 24 seconds
after the previous one.

01:30:26.866 --> 01:30:27.867
So that means

01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:30.870
the time between contractions
is reducing at a rate of...

01:30:31.996 --> 01:30:33.581
21.6 seconds.

01:30:35.082 --> 01:30:36.625
That's pretty fast.

01:30:37.334 --> 01:30:39.003
You better hurry up 'cause
I'm not sticking around...

01:30:39.086 --> 01:30:40.087
- if it gets gross.
- Okay.

01:30:40.796 --> 01:30:42.631
He's heading southwest
on Vernon Avenue.

01:30:42.715 --> 01:30:45.217
I'll cut them off at
the Second Avenue intersection.

01:30:45.926 --> 01:30:46.927
Drive faster.

01:30:47.011 --> 01:30:49.388
Let's go. Let's go, please.

01:30:57.980 --> 01:30:59.523
Hack into traffic control.

01:31:00.524 --> 01:31:01.734
Turn the lights green.

01:31:03.611 --> 01:31:04.945
Amaria, now.

01:31:05.029 --> 01:31:06.739
Turning all traffic lights
to green.

01:31:10.117 --> 01:31:11.535
Why is no one stopping? Hey!

01:31:11.619 --> 01:31:12.870
Ben, watch out!

01:31:14.455 --> 01:31:15.748
- They're not stopping.
- What's happening?

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:17.166
Whoa, whoa.

01:31:17.958 --> 01:31:18.959
Ben!

01:31:21.837 --> 01:31:22.838
Everyone okay?

01:31:22.922 --> 01:31:23.923
Yeah.

01:31:24.006 --> 01:31:25.299
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:31:25.382 --> 01:31:26.383
I'm fine.

01:31:31.722 --> 01:31:32.806
What is that?

01:31:36.852 --> 01:31:38.437
Oh, my God, it's him.

01:31:39.188 --> 01:31:40.189
Guys.

01:31:52.868 --> 01:31:54.161
- Ben, go, go, go!
- Everybody get out right now!

01:31:54.245 --> 01:31:55.371
- Get out, get out, get out!
- Go, go!

01:32:26.819 --> 01:32:27.820
Cassie!

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.905
Get out. Go on.
Get in the ambulance. Go.

01:32:29.989 --> 01:32:31.448
- Come on.
- It's not over. Go.

01:32:31.532 --> 01:32:34.743
Ben, I need you to get Mary
as far away from us as possible.

01:32:34.827 --> 01:32:37.121
Okay? Ezekiel,
he won't care about you now.

01:32:37.204 --> 01:32:38.497
Well, what about you?

01:32:39.123 --> 01:32:41.250
I liked it better
when you didn't make plans.

01:33:04.398 --> 01:33:05.524
You're showing off.

01:33:06.650 --> 01:33:07.651
Not yet.

01:33:08.569 --> 01:33:09.945
I think we lost him.

01:33:15.242 --> 01:33:17.244
Get in the back
and charge the AED.

01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:19.038
- For what?
- Just do it. Go.

01:33:21.582 --> 01:33:23.167
Okay, press "charge."

01:33:23.584 --> 01:33:24.877
Am I having a heart attack?

01:33:25.878 --> 01:33:26.962
I think
I'm having a heart attack.

01:33:27.046 --> 01:33:28.505
You're not gonna
have a heart attack.

01:33:28.589 --> 01:33:29.757
Hey, man!

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:31.467
Okay, get ready.

01:33:33.219 --> 01:33:34.762
Get it close to the ceiling.

01:33:34.845 --> 01:33:36.764
Nobody touch the sides
or anything.

01:33:38.224 --> 01:33:39.558
- Ready?
- Okay. Yep, yep.

01:33:42.811 --> 01:33:44.271
Wait. Wait.

01:33:45.022 --> 01:33:46.398
Now.

01:33:53.822 --> 01:33:54.990
Sorry.

01:33:55.074 --> 01:33:56.200
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:33:56.283 --> 01:33:57.576
- You okay?
- You okay?

01:34:00.204 --> 01:34:01.205
Okay.

01:34:02.331 --> 01:34:03.541
Now you're showing off.

01:34:04.416 --> 01:34:05.417
Maybe a little.

01:34:35.322 --> 01:34:36.323
Now what?

01:34:37.157 --> 01:34:38.659
Those girls cannot exist.

01:34:38.742 --> 01:34:40.244
- ...doesn't look safe.
- It's a death trap.

01:34:40.327 --> 01:34:41.537
...infinite potential.

01:34:42.288 --> 01:34:43.956
This place has
always been a death trap.

01:34:44.039 --> 01:34:45.332
...packed with explosives.

01:34:45.416 --> 01:34:46.625
Get down!

01:34:48.752 --> 01:34:49.753
Go! Run!

01:34:51.505 --> 01:34:52.756
Jump! Come on!

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:53.966
Get in the helicopter.

01:35:01.348 --> 01:35:04.685
I have a code 30. PD-36-307.

01:35:04.768 --> 01:35:07.688
Requesting airlift support.
Dockside, Queens.

01:35:08.689 --> 01:35:09.690
Copy that.

01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:11.150
Okay.

01:35:15.404 --> 01:35:16.739
It's gonna get a little crazy.

01:35:16.822 --> 01:35:18.240
It's already crazy.

01:35:18.699 --> 01:35:19.909
You didn't bail on us.

01:35:20.743 --> 01:35:21.785
Whatever happens,

01:35:21.869 --> 01:35:23.454
I promise
I'm going to protect you guys.

01:35:24.079 --> 01:35:25.539
We'll protect each other.

01:35:25.623 --> 01:35:26.665
Yeah, we're in this together.

01:35:27.374 --> 01:35:28.375
Right?

01:35:28.834 --> 01:35:29.835
Yeah.

01:35:30.961 --> 01:35:32.588
Okay. We are still
not doing a high five.

01:35:33.714 --> 01:35:35.633
I know. It's not cool.

01:35:35.716 --> 01:35:37.092
Let's go. Out the back.

01:35:37.176 --> 01:35:38.302
- What?
- Go, go, go.

01:35:49.188 --> 01:35:50.814
This doesn't look safe.

01:35:50.898 --> 01:35:53.817
Well, it's full of explosives
and it's structurally unsound.

01:35:53.901 --> 01:35:55.736
That doesn't sound safe.

01:35:55.819 --> 01:35:57.363
It's a death trap.

01:35:58.197 --> 01:35:59.740
And that's a good thing?

01:35:59.823 --> 01:36:01.659
As long as we're not the ones
who get trapped.

01:36:03.118 --> 01:36:04.620
No matter what happens...

01:36:04.703 --> 01:36:07.122
we need to work together, okay?

01:36:08.791 --> 01:36:10.751
We're listening this time,
Cassie.

01:36:10.834 --> 01:36:12.628
Yeah, and we won't be impulsive.

01:36:13.462 --> 01:36:14.463
Are we ready?

01:36:20.010 --> 01:36:22.763
We have to get to the roof.
He's gonna be here any minute.

01:36:22.846 --> 01:36:25.099
Here. Take these.

01:36:25.182 --> 01:36:27.434
Put them in
as many crates as you can.

01:36:32.439 --> 01:36:33.440
Okay?

01:36:34.441 --> 01:36:35.818
You two, go that way.

01:36:35.901 --> 01:36:37.611
We need to slow him down.

01:36:37.695 --> 01:36:39.947
- Mattie, this way.
- You come with me. Come on.

01:36:45.578 --> 01:36:46.745
I got this one.

01:36:47.371 --> 01:36:48.664
Come on, Julia. Let's go.

01:37:01.385 --> 01:37:02.469
Anya, go.

01:37:06.181 --> 01:37:07.224
Go.

01:37:18.652 --> 01:37:21.197
Go straight ahead.
When I say "now," get down.

01:37:26.076 --> 01:37:28.078
What do you mean?
It's a dead end.

01:37:30.581 --> 01:37:31.749
Now!

01:37:35.502 --> 01:37:36.629
Whoa!

01:37:36.712 --> 01:37:37.713
Go! Run!

01:37:39.006 --> 01:37:40.424
Now you're really showing off.

01:37:40.925 --> 01:37:42.134
Come on, upstairs.

01:37:53.812 --> 01:37:55.064
I knew. I knew she had a plan.

01:37:55.147 --> 01:37:56.148
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:37:56.649 --> 01:37:57.650
- Hey!
- We're here!

01:37:58.108 --> 01:37:59.485
Down here!

01:38:01.153 --> 01:38:03.447
Make your way to the south side.

01:38:05.908 --> 01:38:06.951
Come on.

01:38:09.912 --> 01:38:11.080
Wait. Get down!

01:38:13.290 --> 01:38:16.210
Let's go. He said south side.
We can go this way.

01:38:17.169 --> 01:38:18.420
Anya, stop!

01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:29.765
- Let's go!
- Mattie!

01:38:37.481 --> 01:38:39.275
- We need to go this way.
- Go down here.

01:38:39.358 --> 01:38:40.776
Get down!

01:38:42.528 --> 01:38:44.363
Go to the ladder. Go!

01:38:46.407 --> 01:38:47.408
Come on, come on!

01:38:52.037 --> 01:38:53.372
Use the web.

01:39:06.969 --> 01:39:08.012
Get to the helicopter.

01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:10.764
- Hey!
- Wait! Girls! Get down!

01:39:13.017 --> 01:39:16.103
It's not safe to land.
You'll have to get higher.

01:39:16.186 --> 01:39:17.479
Guys, this way.

01:39:17.563 --> 01:39:19.565
We can get to the chopper
from up there.

01:39:24.278 --> 01:39:25.446
Anya, jump.

01:39:26.947 --> 01:39:28.741
Jump now! Julia, get back!

01:39:36.123 --> 01:39:37.124
Julia, get down!

01:39:50.054 --> 01:39:51.055
Oh, God!

01:39:52.139 --> 01:39:53.641
You should have walked away.

01:39:55.893 --> 01:39:57.019
You can't protect them.

01:39:57.102 --> 01:39:58.103
Cassie!

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:04.777
Over here, asshole.

01:40:07.279 --> 01:40:08.822
Mattie!

01:40:19.416 --> 01:40:20.918
Don't hurt her!

01:40:28.384 --> 01:40:29.510
Anya!

01:40:32.346 --> 01:40:33.681
Cassie!

01:40:51.282 --> 01:40:52.741
You can't save all three.

01:40:55.619 --> 01:40:57.872
And when you take on
the responsibility...

01:40:58.497 --> 01:41:00.291
great power will come.

01:41:06.755 --> 01:41:09.133
Julia, I got you.

01:41:09.216 --> 01:41:10.217
Come on.

01:41:11.635 --> 01:41:13.846
Mattie. You're gonna be okay.

01:41:13.929 --> 01:41:15.848
Anya. Anya, give me your hand.

01:41:47.504 --> 01:41:49.548
You still can't beat me
with your mind.

01:41:53.135 --> 01:41:54.637
What makes you so sure?

01:42:01.977 --> 01:42:03.979
Come on. Come on, come on.

01:42:04.063 --> 01:42:05.439
You're just like your mother.

01:42:05.523 --> 01:42:07.274
Yes, I am.

01:42:30.047 --> 01:42:32.007
You've been trying
to change your future.

01:42:33.759 --> 01:42:36.011
But the girls
were never your future.

01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:38.722
I was.

01:42:52.778 --> 01:42:54.655
No!

01:43:17.595 --> 01:43:19.555
No. Cassie!

01:44:13.317 --> 01:44:14.610
She's not breathing.

01:44:14.693 --> 01:44:16.278
- Her heart's not beating.
- We know what to do.

01:44:17.071 --> 01:44:18.072
Beginning compressions.

01:44:19.198 --> 01:44:21.617
Interlock your fingers.
Come back, Cassie.

01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:22.993
Come on, guys. Come on!

01:44:24.578 --> 01:44:26.121
Keep going. We don't stop.

01:44:27.039 --> 01:44:28.040
Come on, Cassie.

01:44:29.124 --> 01:44:30.334
I'm getting a little tired.

01:44:30.417 --> 01:44:31.752
Okay. I'm right here.

01:44:32.836 --> 01:44:34.255
Cassie, wake up! Please.

01:44:34.338 --> 01:44:36.006
- Cassie!
- Come back, Cassie.

01:44:37.841 --> 01:44:39.635
We're here, Cassie.
We're not leaving you.

01:44:40.344 --> 01:44:42.263
Cassie, you got this.
Please. I need you. Please.

01:44:44.598 --> 01:44:45.808
Oh, my God!

01:44:46.517 --> 01:44:47.518
Cassie.

01:44:48.852 --> 01:44:50.437
- It's okay.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:44:50.521 --> 01:44:51.522
Oh, my God. We did it.

01:44:56.527 --> 01:44:57.778
We did it.

01:45:18.883 --> 01:45:19.884
Hi.

01:45:22.344 --> 01:45:23.596
Hello.

01:45:23.679 --> 01:45:24.680
Hi.

01:45:26.974 --> 01:45:28.684
Oh, he's perfect.

01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:30.561
He is.

01:45:31.061 --> 01:45:32.688
- He's perfect.
- Yeah.

01:45:40.404 --> 01:45:41.697
We're still here, Cassie.

01:45:42.489 --> 01:45:43.991
Yeah. We're not leaving you.

01:45:44.992 --> 01:45:45.993
I wouldn't be here

01:45:46.076 --> 01:45:47.494
if it weren't
for the three of you.

01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:49.496
Right back at ya.

01:45:49.997 --> 01:45:50.998
Ben said to tell you

01:45:51.081 --> 01:45:52.499
that the baby
is doing really well.

01:45:53.292 --> 01:45:54.877
And he's loving being an uncle.

01:45:56.003 --> 01:45:59.006
Yeah. All the fun
and none of the responsibility.

01:46:00.090 --> 01:46:01.592
That's what he thinks.

01:46:04.803 --> 01:46:07.139
Are you all immediate family?

01:46:07.598 --> 01:46:08.807
Yes.

01:46:10.017 --> 01:46:11.435
They're all mine.

01:46:18.526 --> 01:46:20.027
Can we get you anything?

01:46:20.110 --> 01:46:21.111
No.

01:46:22.029 --> 01:46:24.114
I have everything I need
right here.

01:46:53.769 --> 01:46:54.770
No.

01:46:58.357 --> 01:47:01.569
You left your junk mail
downstairs again.

01:47:01.652 --> 01:47:04.822
And we got takeout.
But we didn't know...

01:47:04.905 --> 01:47:06.532
Kung Pao chicken is perfect.

01:47:06.615 --> 01:47:07.908
How'd you know?

01:47:08.659 --> 01:47:09.743
Bless you, Anya.

01:47:09.827 --> 01:47:10.828
What?

01:47:13.372 --> 01:47:14.373
Thank you.

01:47:18.210 --> 01:47:19.211
Mattie!

01:47:19.295 --> 01:47:21.714
What? I told you I'm starving.

01:47:21.797 --> 01:47:23.465
And I told you guys
that you wouldn't...

01:47:23.549 --> 01:47:25.301
...wouldn't like you
if you were hangry.

01:47:25.384 --> 01:47:27.177
Well, you wouldn't, so...

01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:29.471
How's your eyesight?

01:47:30.014 --> 01:47:31.682
I can see better
than I ever have.

01:47:31.765 --> 01:47:32.766
Oh, yeah?

01:47:33.392 --> 01:47:35.686
Can you see us in the future?

01:47:36.604 --> 01:47:37.730
Yes.

01:47:38.981 --> 01:47:40.191
I can see you.

01:47:42.109 --> 01:47:44.069
Standing up
for what you believe.

01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:50.910
Never giving up.

01:47:56.457 --> 01:47:59.376
Discovering you were always
more powerful than you thought.

01:48:01.128 --> 01:48:02.922
Nothing I didn't already know.

01:48:05.633 --> 01:48:07.051
I don't know about you two...

01:48:07.635 --> 01:48:09.845
but that totally
makes sense to me.

01:48:10.429 --> 01:48:12.348
- What? I'm serious.
- Wow.

01:48:14.934 --> 01:48:16.435
What? I'm being serious.

01:48:20.356 --> 01:48:22.691
Oh, wow. Okay. Wow.

01:48:31.992 --> 01:48:33.536
Whatever the future holds...

01:48:39.583 --> 01:48:40.793
we'll be ready.

01:48:43.087 --> 01:48:44.964
And you know the best thing
about the future?

01:48:47.091 --> 01:48:49.009
It hasn't happened yet.
